to pass up sesfscriptf pass what up i mean these fish swim out of the ocean they flop around on the beach they swim away and then they die sesfscriptm yeah but thisthis moment on the beach is like the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what to do spawning or mating or whatever sesfscriptm this is a big night for these little guys its like lifes last orgy sesfscriptf i dont see why youre so excited this isnt a freaking moon landing we are talking about its fish its a fish nobody even eats sesfscriptm yeah they do sesfscriptf oh augie sesfscriptm okay well whatever but its a fish who do something no other fish do its like those swallows returning to capistrano or like those lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs sesfscriptm theres like mystery here theres magic its like a little bit of the unexplainable i just cant see how youre not interested sesfscriptf im just not sesfscriptm for real sesfscriptf yeah sesfscriptm god i dont get it you know the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life sesfscriptm and last year i remember distinctly you said you were so excited to get here that you dont remember you

the grunions sesfscriptm ahhwe werent in a good spot sesfscriptf hmm we didnt see them the year before either sesfscriptm we just werent in a good spot im telling you this is a much better spot i have instincts for these things f mumbles oh yeah sesfscriptm look there see whats that no thats thats just seaweed sesfscriptm god this is great think about this i know you are not interested but just think about this sesfscriptm right now out there there is this mass of silver fish and its heading this way no one sent them an invitation no one told them no one even gave them a map sesfscriptm just all at once they turned and they formed this line as long as the california coast and some instinctual little firecracker went off in their bodies and they all just turned as one and started swimming sesfscriptm they are swimming right now they are swimming as if that is the only thing that matters to them sesfscriptm its single mindedness with no mind it is urgency that is just pure urge sesfscriptm and they are swimming right now to this very point where we stand for this huge celebration of sex and death sesfscriptm oh look im giving myself goose bumps my hairs are standing up on my arm sesfscriptf thats the wind sesfscriptm so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm about all of that about all i was talking about sesfscriptm look at this all of the hairs are standing up on my arm sesfscriptf thats the wind sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm about what i was saying sesfscriptf i think its ridiculous sesfscriptm it certainly is not its slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesfscriptf its pr somebody sold you a bunch of crap that there is this wonderful thing that is going to happen tonight on the beach sesfscriptm not just me look at all of these people sesfscriptf everybodys told the same story it keeps us coming back for more it keeps us excited we keep thinking that life is going start at any minute if we can just find the right spot get in on the action sesfscriptm are we talking about the same thing here sesfscriptf im sorry its just fish to me sesfscriptm carla can i ask you something now dont take this the wrong way but are you on your period sesfscriptf dont ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that its insulting sesfscriptm well then whats bugging you sesfscriptf we just have different ideas of what this night is supposed to look like sesfscriptm there is nothing to it we come down here the fish arrive they flop around they do their fish thing we go ooh ah look at the fish and we go home sesfscriptf for god grow up augie the fish are not going to arrive sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf because they never do have theyhave they ever sesfscriptm weve missed them twice sesfscriptf twice is every time we have tried thats ever sesfscriptm theyll show up this time sesfscriptf no they wont its like waiting for santa claus sesfscriptf i feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on this beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show up sesfscriptm i thought you wanted to see it sesfscriptf you dont understand anything i am saying sesfscriptm no of course not sesfscriptf i did want to see it i still do i always do i just sesfscriptf i feel like im always just standing here waiting i feel like this night is going to be the night but it never is sesfscriptm its just fish its nothing to get traumatized over sesfscriptf for gods sake this is not about fish sesfscriptm okay im trying to work this backwards and pinpoint the exact moment where we took a turn for the worst here sesfscriptm okay so you were fine during that phone call from marge and then dinner was okay and doing the dishes was fine and then i was going to take a shower and youre watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight do you want to go and i said sure great lets go sesfscriptm okay so i am putting out the pets getting the car out of the garage sesfscriptf do you remember the first year we came here it was like four years after we got married sesfscriptf we thought i was pregnant we got a bottle of champagne we had no glasses we took off our shoes and you asked me to dance sesfscriptf you whispered the sweetest most intimate things to me right into my ear so i could feel them as much as hear them and i remember thinking this is it you know finally i am as happy as im supposed to be sesfscriptm wait a minute i got it sesfscriptf drinking champagne from the bottle sesfscriptm its when we were driving past that knickerbocker liquor locker you said lets get some champagne i said no times a wasting or something like that sesfscriptf dancing barefoot in the sand sesfscriptm thats what it is right you want this to be like the other time right sesfscriptf id rather not remember some things id rather not hope for some things sesfscriptm sure all right okay sesfscriptm listen do you want to dance sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm do you want me to go get some champagne sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm do you want to take off your shoes sesfscriptf no no nothing sesfscriptm then what sesfscriptm do you want to get married again sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm what what do you want a divorce sesfscriptm a vacation sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm like a new carpet a poodle a back rub ice cream a suicide pact what do you want what the hell do you want sesfscriptf i just want something to turn out like i expected it to sesfscriptm well welcome to the human race huh do you think i had some grand fantasy going that four years down the line we would come to this beach and be arguing over fish no sesfscriptf breathing sesfscriptm no im just like you i thought it was going to be all roses and peaches and the bills would just pay themselves and well have three fat rosy cheeked children huh baby the jokes on us because you know what you get sesfscriptm do you know what you get you get this sesfscriptf this what is this this is nothing this isnt even anything sesfscriptm yes it is sesfscriptf sure this is standing on the beach waiting this is fighting sesfscriptm right sesfscriptf i mean this is a lot of things but its just sesfscriptm breathing sesfscriptf do you understand what i am saying sesfscriptm im doing the best i can sesfscriptf i know you are augie i know sesfscriptf i know you meant this to be special i know that you wanted it to be right but i just cant help thinking that i cant help wishing that i was somewhere else sesfscriptm maybe if you were with someone else too sesfscriptf i didnt say that sesfscriptm i just i know i dont make you happy sesfscriptf dont be ridiculous anything that anything i am doing id rather be doing it with you sesfscriptm yeah sesfscriptf yeah dont you know that sesfscriptf for heavens sake augie sesfscriptf youre the one who probably wishes he was with somebody else somebody who doesnt take things so seriously who could enjoy herself sesfscriptm you know actually now that you mention it no i dont sesfscriptf so maybe we are in the wrong spot but we are with the right person sesfscriptm i dont know it seemed like such a good spot to me sesfscriptm we have a great view of the moon from here though huh sesfscriptf hmm i noticed that its pretty big old white moon sesfscriptm breathing sesfscriptm and look what i got here sesfscriptf augie you bought refreshments sesfscriptm its not champagne sesfscriptf i guess we dont need glasses sesfscriptm breathing sesfscriptm do you want to go home are you cold sesfscriptf im beginning to think this might be the right spot after all sesfscriptf augie im sorry sesfscriptm shh if were very quiet the fish might come sesfscriptf or not sesfscriptm or not sesfscriptm good god sesfscriptf is it them sesfscriptm i wonder sesfscriptf freda is the only one who knows we are here she wouldnt ring up sesfscriptm it

once before that ive had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long a child of two cannot get drunk on that sesfscriptf on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk on only one glass

sesmscriptf breathing and then youve been kind of sesmscriptm what sesmscriptf youve been kind of embarrassed ever since i got here sesmscriptm i was kind of planning on sneaking up on you you know over like a course of a week or so they just take for granted that were already set sesmscriptf i knew they would your mother anyway sesmscriptm you did sesmscriptf from her point of view why else

ann i love you i love you sesmscriptm i love you a great deal sesmscriptm im sorry i dont really have much of an imagination sesmscriptf chris flaughter sesmscriptm im sorry im embarrassing you arent i see i didnt want to do it here i didnt on this porch with this ringi didnt want to win you away from anything sesmscriptf ive been ready a long long time sesmscriptm so then hes gone you sure sesmscriptf i almost got married two years ago sesmscriptm why didnt you sesmscriptf you started to write me sesmscriptm you felt something that far back sesmscriptf everyday since sesmscriptm why didnt you let me know sesmscriptf because i was waiting for you chris till then you never wrote me and then when you did well you sure can be ambiguous you know sesmscriptm oh annie why dont you go ahead and give me a kiss come on just a sesmscriptm i kissed you i kissed annie sesmscriptf ill never forgive you for waiting so long all i did was sit around and wonder if i was crazy for thinking about you sesmscriptm i kissed you sesmscriptf like larrys brother do what like you chris sesmscriptf chris whats the matter sesmscriptm do you want to go somewhere lets go sesmscriptf no what is it

now f you got to sesmscriptf you got to tell me sesmscriptm i dont know f but what if sesmscriptm its kind of all mixed up with all these other things sesmscriptf wouldnt work like this sesmscriptm you know over seas i was in command of the company sesmscriptf yeah sure sesmscriptm well i lost them sesmscriptf how many sesmscriptm pretty much all sesmscriptf breathing geez sesmscriptm takes awhile to toss something like that off i mean they werent just men you know sesmscriptm for instance there was this one time when this kidit had been raining for like several days and he gave me his last pair of dry socks sesmscriptm he just put it in my pocket thats the kind of guys i had sesmscriptm they didnt die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly you know a little more selfish and theyll all be here today sesmscriptm and i had this idea as i was watching them go down like everything was being destroyed you know but i felt like this one new thing was being made you know its kind of like this this monument sesmscriptm you know that they were bringing something on to this earth a kind of sacrifice you know sesmscriptm i thought i would change everything you know and i got back here and it was it was like nothing had changed at all sesmscriptm you know i went to work with dad and i started that whole rat race again sesmscriptm and no one had changed it was just like sort of random bus accident to them sesmscriptm driving my new car and i felt guilty you know opening my bank book seeing a new refrigerator sesmscriptm cause you can take those things out of a war but you have to realize that those things came out of the love that a man can have for another man sesmscriptm and if you cant see that then its just loot and theres blood all over it sesmscriptm i felt ashamed and i didnt want any part of it i guess i included you too sesmscriptf do you still feel that way sesmscriptm i want you to know annie sesmscriptf cause you mustnt feel that way everything you have you have a right to sesmscriptf everything chris do you understand that to me too sesmscriptf and your money theres nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes into the air you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that sesmscriptm annie sesmscriptm im going to make a fortune for you sesmscriptf what would i do with a fortune sesmscriptm what time is it god this is great isnt it i cant believe it sesmscriptm of course i did want to a little further up the coast you know get away from all the lights and people and everything is it

kidding we just got here we dont want to turn around and go home now whats the point coming all the way down here sesmscriptf there is no point sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf thats my point sesmscriptm thats my point too sesmscriptf then lets go sesmscriptm no wait no no thats not my point my point is there is no point and coming all the way down here if we just turn around and go home sesmscriptm dont you want to see it sesmscriptf not particularly sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf i just dont its stupid sesmscriptm its not stupid its a natural phenomenon sesmscriptm people in kansas would have to get plane tickets and make hotel reservations to see this its only forty minutes away its just too good to pass up sesmscriptf pass what up these little fish swim out of the ocean they flop around on the sand then they swim back and then they die sesmscriptm yeah but that like flopping around is what to do its like spawning or mating or something this is like the highlight of their little fish lives its like lifes last orgy sesmscriptf i dont know what youre so excited about this isnt a moon landing were talking about its fish its a fish nobody even eats sesmscriptm yeah they do sesmscriptf oh augie sesmscriptm well okay whatever okay but its a fish who do something that like no other fish do you know its like those swallows that return to capistrano or those like those lemmings that jumped off the cliffs you know sesmscriptm its like a little bit of the unexplainable a little magic a little mystery i just dont see how you can not be interested in this sesmscriptf im not sesmscriptm for real sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm all right sesmscriptm i dont get it though i mean the first time we came here you said it was like the best night of your life sesmscriptm and last year i remember like distinctively you were so excited to get here that you didnt realize you stubbed your toe until we were in a car sesmscriptf last year youll also remember we gotour shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight and we did not see the grunions sesmscriptm we just werent in a good spot though sesmscriptf we didnt see them the year before either sesmscriptm we just werent in a good spot im telling you this is a much better spot sesmscriptm come on trust me i got instincts for these things okay so justjust think about it all right okay i know youre not interested think about it sesmscriptm out there theres like this big mass of silver fish theyre heading this way sesmscriptm they dont know why we dont know why no one like sent them an invitation or gave them a map or direction sesmscriptm they just all turned at once and they just form this line as long as the california coast and they just started swimming sesmscriptm like some little time release fire cracker went off inside their little tiny bodies and they all turned as one sesmscriptm and form the line and started swimming swimming that would bring them to this point here sesmscriptm its like urgency thats pure urge you know its singlemindedness with no mind sesmscriptm its crazy look at this im giving myself goose bumps the hairs are standing up on my arm sesmscriptf thats the wind sesmscriptm theyre out there swimming right now sesmscriptm to this spot for this massive celebration of like sex and death sesmscriptm look at this my hairs are standing up my arm im giving myself goose bumps sesmscriptf thats the wind sesmscriptm well so what do you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm about what i was saying sesmscriptf i think its ridiculous sesmscriptm it certainly is not its like slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesmscriptf its a pr sesmscriptf somebody sold you a bill of goods that something amazing is going to happen on the beach sesmscriptm its not just me okay look at like all the people sesmscriptf theyre all told the same thing sesmscriptf everybody is believes that it keeps them excited you know it keeps them coming back for more sesmscriptf everybody keeps thinking that they can just find the right spot you know theyll get it on the action sesmscriptf their life will start then sesmscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesmscriptf im sorry it still just fish to me sesmscriptm can i ask you a question are you on your period sesmscriptf why do you ask me that god damn it i told you not to ask me that i hate it when you ask me that its insulting sesmscriptm okay well then whats bugging you sesmscriptf i just we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like sesmscriptm is not supposed to like anything we come down here we look at the fish they arrive we go wooah fish sesmscriptf oh grow up augie the fish are not going to come sesmscriptm and then we go home and they go home sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf because they never do do they have they ever sesmscriptm we missed them twice sesmscriptf twice is every year weve tried thats ever sesmscriptm okay well see them this year this is a much better spot trust me sesmscriptf no we wont its pointless its like a waiting up to see santa claus sesmscriptf i feel like my whole life is going to be spent here on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for fish to show up and the fish never show sesmscriptm okay im trying to work this backwards sesmscriptf you dont understand anything im saying sesmscriptm and figure out where we took a turn to the worst thing sesmscriptm of course not sesmscriptf i did want to see it i still do i always do i keep thinking that this time will be the time but it just never is sesmscriptm okay im trying to work this backwards here and im trying to figure out the exact moment that you took a turn for the worst here now sesmscriptm you were fine

always had a weak head sesmscriptm i think i told you once before that i had three minute liquor glasses the whole evening long a child of two cannot get drunk on that sesmscriptf on the contrary a child two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy sesmscriptm oh very very interesting amanda how about the child of uh four six or maybe nineyou know we could work up a splendid little

justyou gotta keep going i mean youve been going at it for so long you know something is definitely going to come up ii know it will because youre a good worker sesfimprof i just keep getting rejected i just keep getting rejected over and over and over again and it starts to make you feel like there must be something wrong with you that you cant get a job sesfimprom no itsi mean its competitive you know thatsthats what it is thats what you gotta be is competitive sesfimprof yeah but maybeif just because its competitive like maybe im just not good enough maybe the level is here and im here and theres just no way im ever gonna do that sesfimprom therethere are plenty of people out there withwith like good jobs you know that are a lot sesfimprom dumber than you i mean theyre a lot worse off than you you are much better off than like a lot of those people in there i know sesfimprof i didnt have like one of those starts you know like a family member who was already in the business or something you know that could like give me a helping hand sesfimprom i know it makes it harder i mean its definitely who you know in a lot of cases but sesfimprof its just so frustrating like i justi just dont wanna do it anymore you know i just dont wanna like hit the pavement every single day with my resumes and going out there all the time you know its just like sesfimprom but you gotta otherwise what iswhats your other option sesfimprof i feel so worthless sesfimprom its not worthless cause its definitely gonnaits definitely gonna pay off i know it i mean i canive justive seen your work etiquette you know youre a good worker and sesfimprom and theres no reason thatthat something wont come up like really soon all right so you just gotta sesfimprof and what would make you say that there doesnt seem to be any indicators that anythings going to get better sesfimprom because i know you you know and maybe once you get to know some more people like talking to them and everything theyll get to know you too and theyll realize they shouldve hired you three years ago you know but and and theyll finally come around and believe meitllyou gotta sesfimprof its just really hard i feel like their starting to get like a personal prejudice against me you know what i mean like its like suddenly it starts to feel like its just you that they say no to and its not that theyre not taking applications and its not that theyre not hiring people its just you particularly they have some particular reason for just hating you you know sesfimprom well maybe yeah but maybe you get to that point where its like you bug em and then they just dont wanna hear from you anymore but you keep bugging them and bugging them and then its gonna annoy them so much that theyre gonna be like all right fine you know sesfimprof or theyll never talk to me again sesfimprom or well no okay you garbage sesfimprof ii just i think maybe i should try something else i mean ii dont know all growing up this is the only thing that i ever wanted to do and yet i cant im not physically able apparently i mean sesfimprom that obviously thats not true though i mean youve done this before youve done all the work like this before you know and and youve gotten people saying oh youre so good and like you know sesfimprof i guess the money shouldnt matter to me butsomehow it does you know its not like i do it for the money but sesfimprom right sesfimprom well youve gotta live sesfimprof you have toi mean if youre hired by somebody then youre not a professional youre an amateur and that means that youre not good enough sesfimprom i mean its just its reallyi dont know yeah its about their opinions and its about i dont know just getting yourself out there and sesfimprof i just wanna crawl in a hole you know like it just makes you not wanna even open your eyes in the morning sesfimprom well come on come on thinking about it like this is definitely not gonna help either though sesfimprof i dont know how to get out of it i dont know how to dig myself out of it its the same hole that ive been digging and digging and digging i cant sesfimprom i dont know sesfimprof hi um excuse me i believe that the airline lost my baggage sesfimprom um okay it didntdidnt come out on the carrousel sesfimprof no it didnt um it didnt come out and i dont see it anywhere around here so what can you do about that sesfimprom okay um well unfortunately yeah there was a some some problems with the sesfimprof some problems what is that supposed to mean sesfimprom uh well somesome of the bags werewere lost on the way over here uh sesfimprof how do you lose a suitcase a huge suitcase sesfimprom you know i mean theres a lot of things that go on under the plane and sometimes you know that kind of things happen sesfimprom uh but we are willing to reimburse you for the bag and and for the contents sesfimprof how much sesfimprom um wed be willing to give you uh fifty dollars for sesfimprof fifty dollars for my suitcase i mean the suitcase itself was like a hundred and fifty dollar just for the suitcase but all the things inside all my clothes all my personal belongings the sentimental value not to mention which is moremore than all of that together sesfimprom right uh we realize you know that that its a bad situation but im sorry theres nothing that we can really do sesfimprof thats all thats all thats all youre going to do is just give me fifty dollars and say go have fun on your vacation without any of your stuff sesfimprom i think um maybe you can file a claim if you want and turn it in to our main office sesfimprof yes yes i would like to file a claim but what are you gonnai mean is it just gonna show up magically out of nowhere sesfimprom right no i mean they they mightthey mightif youif you are argue the case more maybe theyll reimburse you more but right now sesfimprof i need my stuff itsi need my stuff i mean uh sesfimprof havent you ever lost baggage i mean isnt there anything else you do sesfimprom yes i know i know its its frustrating unfortunately though um sesfimprof because you dont seem to care very much you know sesfimprom by checking your bags youyou you know admit to the liability thats thats at risk sesfimprof i didnt sign anything sesfimprom right well by checking in your bags you agreed to you know at the will of the sesfimprof i didnt agree garbage i paid the airline to take care of things for me when you pay for something there should be some sort of guarantee that its gonna come through sesfimprom you paid for the flight and then your bags were checked atits a service that the airline provides for us so so really its really the risk was taken and im sorry but theres really nothing else we can do so do you wantdo you want the reimbursement sesfimprof breathing well sure yeah i guess ill go buy dinner and then behave nothing for the rest of my entire vacation im supposed to be here for three weeks what am i gonna do without anything for three weeks sesfimprom well there arethere are some shops here in in the airport sesfimprof but fifty dollars isnt going to get me anything sesfimprom no um like i said you can file a claim and uh maybe get reimbursed for more you sesfimprof isnt there anything else you can do sesfimprom probably even talk to sesfimprof i mean is there somebody you can call or the guy that put the stuff on theon the plane i mean are theythey must be really irresponsible to have just disappeared my baggage i mean did it get stolen sesfimprom right thatthat gets taken care of that gets taken care of we get we do you know we investigate those and just make sure that um theyre not doing their own thing with them souh f he needs to look into that sesfimprof yeah im sure you youre like hmm do you take

want you to be ready for me i dont want to have to win you away from anything sesfscriptf oh chris ive been ready for a long long time sesfscriptm and hes gone forever youre sure sesfscriptf i almost got married two years ago sesfscriptm why didnt you sesfscriptf you started to write me and sesfscriptm you felt something that far back sesfscriptf every day since sesfscriptm anne why didnt you let

sesfscriptm oh god i kissed you i kissed annie how longhow long ive been waiting to kiss you sesfscriptf i will never forgive you why did you wait all these years all i did was sit and wonder if i was

you chris what is it sesfscriptm lets drive someplace i want to be alone with you sesfscriptf no what is it your mother sesfscriptm no nothing like that sesfscriptf then whats wrong i mean even in your letters there was somesomething ashamed sesfscriptm yeah i suppose i have been but its going from me sesfscriptf youve gotta tell me sesfscriptm i dont know how to start sesfscriptf it wouldnt work this way sesfscriptm its all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in command of a company sesfscriptf yeah sure sesfscriptm well i lost them sesfscriptf how many sesfscriptm just about all sesfscriptf oh gee sesfscriptm it takes some time for a guy to toss that off cause they werent just men sesfscriptm for instance one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks i put them in pocket its only a little thing but thats the kind of guys i had sesfscriptm they didnt die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and theyd have been here today sesfscriptm i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that there was one new thing being made a sort of responsibility man for man sesfscriptm you know what i mean to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him sesfscriptm then i came back and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident i went to work with dad and that rat race again sesfscriptm and i felt what you said ashamed somehow cause nobody was changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator sesfscriptm i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car youve gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man youve gotta be a little better because of it sesfscriptm because otherwise all you have is really loot and theres blood on it and i didnt want to take any of it and i guess that included you sesfscriptf you still feel that way sesfscriptm i want you now annie sesfscriptf cause you mustnt feel that way because you have a right to everything that you have do you understand that everything chris and me too sesfscriptf i mean and your money theres nothing wrong with your money i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air a man should be paid for that sesfscriptm i know annie annie im gonna make a fortune for you sesfscriptf whatll i do with a fortune sesfscriptm what time is it theyre supposed to run around midnight sesfscriptm this is great isnt it look at the night weve got here couldnt be better sesfscriptm i would have liked to have gone a little further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid wed miss it sesfscriptm how you doing sesfscriptf fine sesfscriptm is thatnois that just foam i cant even tell sesfscriptm well i guess we can tell it probably isnt right probably be unmistakable dont you think sesfscriptm how you doing aw you know what i forgot i forgot to bring my flashlight oh how could i be so stupid i shouldve brought my flashlight sesfscriptf what flashlight sesfscriptm you know the flashlight the silver one theres only one isnt there sesfscriptf thats not your flashlight sesfscriptm whos is it sesfscriptf its ours its mine too sesfscriptm oh well sure sesfscriptf you kept saying my flashlight

my jacket sesfscriptf its after eleven lets just go home sesfscriptm are you kidding wed miss it we just got here whats the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home sesfscriptf there is no point in coming down here sesfscriptm right sesfscriptf thats my point sesfscriptm thats my point too sesfscriptf so lets go sesfscriptm no no thats not my point the point is theres no point in coming down if we just leave dont you want to see it sesfscriptf not particularly sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf i just dont its stupid sesfscriptm honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean this only happens once a year you know sesfscriptm think about the people in kansas they had to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to see this we live forty minutes away its too good to pass up sesfscriptf pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach they flop around and swim away and then they die sesfscriptm yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping is laying eggs or what do youspawning or mating i mean sesfscriptm this is a big night for these guys lifes last orgy sesfscriptf what are you so excited about i mean its not a moon landing were talking about here its fish its a fish nobody even eats sesfscriptm yeah they do sesfscriptf ah augie sesfscriptm alright but its fish that do something that none of the other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs sesfscriptm therestheres a bit of the magicsome unexplainable here i dont see how you can not be interested sesfscriptf im just not sesfscriptm for real sesfscriptf yeah sesfscriptm i dont get it the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life sesfscriptm and last year i remember specifically you were so excited to go that you stubbed your toe rushing me out of the house and didnt even notice until we got in the car sesfscriptf last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got in a big fight over nothing and we didnt see the grunions sesfscriptm we werent in a good spot sesfscriptf we didnt see them the first time either sesfscriptm we just werent in a good spot this is a much better spot believe me ive got good instincts for these things sesfscriptm there is thatno thats just seaweed isnt it sesfscriptm oh man this is great isnt it i wouldnt miss this for anything here think about this all right i know youre not interested but think about this sesfscriptm somewhere out there this huge mass of silver fish swimming this way sesfscriptm they dont know why we dont know why nobody sent them an invitation or a map it wasnt a decision just sesfscriptm all as one this time release instinctual little firecracker went off and they all turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming and theyre swimming right now as if thats all that matters sesfscriptm its like single mindedness with no mind its urgency thats pure urge they dont know what drives them they dont ask it a question or give it a name sesfscriptm they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them right here to where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death sesfscriptm ah god im giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are popped up sesfscriptf thats the wind sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm what i was saying sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm what i was saying sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm it certainly is not its slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesfscriptf its pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is gonna take place on the beach sesfscriptm well im not the only one look at all these people sesfscriptf sure everybodys told the same story it keeps us all excited it keeps us coming back for more it keeps us thinking that life is gonna start any second now if we could just find the right spot and get in on the action sesfscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesfscriptf well im sorry but its still just fish to me sesfscriptm carla can i ask you something dont take this wrong but are you having your period sesfscriptf god damn it augie dont ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that its insulting sesfscriptm well whats bugging you sesfscriptf we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like sesfscriptm theres nothing to it we come here the grunion arrive they do their little fish business we go ooh ah look at the fish they go home we go home sesfscriptf for heaven sake were not going to see the grunions sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf we never do do we i mean have we ever sesfscriptm weve missed them twice thats not ever sesfscriptf twice is every time weve tried thats ever sesfscriptm well well see them this year sesfscriptf no we wont its pointless its like waiting up to see santa claus sesfscriptf i mean i feel like my whole life is gonna be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up and the fish wont show up sesfscriptm i thought you wanted to see it sesfscriptf you dont understand anything im saying sesfscriptm no of course not sesfscriptf i did want to see it i always do i keep thinking that this is gonna be the time and it never is sesfscriptm its just fish nothing to get traumatized about sesfscriptf for heaven sake this isnt about fish sesfscriptm all right look ive been trying to work this backwards but i cannot seem to figure out the exact moment that we took a turn for the worst sesfscriptm i mean you were you were fine during

superficial and pity the poor philosophers lets blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like quite idiotic very small school children lets savor the delight of the moment sesfscriptm come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets sesfscriptf elliott worms dont pop sesfscriptm i dont care what you do see you could paint yourself green and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shant say a word as long as you love me best sesfscriptf oh thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch so much as looking at another woman ill kill you sesfscriptm you remember that awful scene we had in venice sesfscriptf which particular one sesfscriptm the one when you

sesfscriptm that was a rouser wasnt it sesfscriptf that was the first time you ever hit me sesfscriptm i didnt hit you very hard sesfscriptf the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers sesfscriptm oh ill never forget his face sesfscriptf it was ridiculous completely ridiculous sesfscriptm we were very much younger then sesfscriptf and very much sillier sesfscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesfscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesfscriptf honey you knew there was nothing in that sesfscriptm i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him sesfscriptf presents just a trivial little broach sesfscriptm ah yes i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste sesfscriptf no it wasnt it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often sesfscriptm you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden sesfscriptf no i didnt you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination sesfscriptm you must admit he was in love with you wasnt he sesfscriptf just a little perhaps nothing serious sesfscriptm you let him kiss you you said you did sesfscriptf well what of it sesfscriptm what of it sesfscriptf it didnt hurt him at all and i enjoyed it sesfscriptm well what about me sesfscriptf well if you hadnt been so suspicious

brandy sesfscriptf no thanks sesfscriptm i think ill have some sesfscriptf dont see why you want any youve already had two glasses sesfscriptm no particular reason anyhow they were very small ones sesfscriptf just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing sesfscriptm you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on sesfscriptf well its become a habit with you sesfscriptm you neednt be so grand just because you dont happen to want any yourself at the moment sesfscriptf dont be so stupid sesfscriptm really amanda sesfscriptf what sesfscriptm

sesfscriptm nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap sesfscriptf they sting sesfscriptm they snap sesfscriptf i dont care do you understand i dont care i dont care if they bark or roll about like hoops sesfscriptm did you see much of peter burden after our divorce sesfscriptf yes i did quite a lot sesfscriptm hmm i imagine you let him kiss you a good deal more then sesfscriptf mind your own business sesfscriptm oh must have had a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable and never had much anyhow sesfscriptf youre quite insufferable sesfscriptf i expect its because youre drunk sesfscriptm im not in the least drunk sesfscriptf youve always had a weak head sesfscriptm as i mentioned before i have had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldnt get drunk on that sesfscriptf on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy sesfscriptm oh very interesting how about a child of four a child of six or a child of nine sesfscriptf shut up sesfscriptm we could get a good debate going about this dont you think intemperate tots sesfscriptf not very funny dear youd better have some more brandy sesfscriptm all right i will sesfscriptm you better turn that off i think sesfscriptf why sesfscriptm because its late and itll annoy the people upstairs sesfscriptf there arent any

sesmimprom well were thinking uh were thinking winter time you know were going to do it in the winter and then maybe you know maybe sesmimprom i dont know either do a honeymoon like in the snow or fly down to like australia southern hemisphere garbage so well decide with that sesmimprof ooh that would be fun sesmimprof do you think youll get a house or something like you guys are looking to buy some place or sesmimprom yea yea im not too sure where yet i guess you know i kind of got to figure some stuff out here first sesmimprof yeah laughter sesmimprom but like you know its just i guess

sesmimprof yay well congratulations thats so cool breathing i cant wait sesmimprom hah sesmimprom uhm i dont know sesmimprof so how you feeling sesmimprom i dont know what im going to do about this i mean sesmimprom i have got to get a job you know like sesmimprof youve been doing a lot of work for it right sesmimprom well yea you know i get my resumes and i mean i sesmimprof right so the fact you doing the best that you can is sesmimprom i go out all the places i can every place thatll give an interview you know sesmimprof you know you shouldnt give yourself a hard time for that its the best you can sesmimprom but its been so long like what what am i what am i waiting i should probably just do something else or sesmimprof well but you care about what you do right sesmimprom i dont know i mean why why sesmimprom yea but its its almost like its not worth it you know if im going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job i mean once i actually do get the job its like oh retirement or something i dont know you know f yeah sesmimprof i understand that its so frustrating but i know that youre here because you really want it you know and and uh sesmimprom well and thats what i begin to question after a while is maybe i just dont want it maybe its not even worth it you know like sesmimprom i dont even know if its going to be worth it because i cant break myself in you know like i cant cant even get a foot in the door you know sesmimprof well i mean youre still here youve tried for this long so i think that says something all in itself sesmimprom yea it says im stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else f no it means you have persistence sesmimprof you are persistence i mean thats important thats sesmimprom i mean i cant i cant be persistent forever you know you cant not have a job forever you know ive got ive got to do something ive got to make money and get food on the table sesmimprof well youre talented so keep that in mind you know you shouldnt give yourself too hard of a time sesmimprom i mean maybe im not you know i dont have a job maybe maybe im not as good asas i thought i was and sesmimprom i just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and sesmimprof im sorry sesmimprom i dont know its just not i dont know i dont know what to do really you know im just thinking sesmimprom maybe maybe take up painting i dont know you know sesmimprom do something that i dont have to go out and do something stay at home i dont know sesmimprom seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment sesmimprof thats i mean there are more factors then just whether youre good or not you know what i mean like sesmimprof and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether its male or female or you know what i mean like things are out of your control sesmimprof so you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time sesmimprom i know but i mean if thats the you know im either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet i mean this doesnt sesmimprof it might be the latter i dont know because youre not the worst i mean youre great you very talented at what you do sesmimprom this doesnt happen to a normal person sesmimprof you know and the fact you still here and still cooking like its good that youre thinking about it that youre reconsidering sesmimprof but like just because youre considering why its been so difficult doesnt mean you should just stop sesmimprom i mean i dont know i dont see i dont see any other way any other way around it right now sesmimprof maybe you should take a little break from it but i dont think you should stop m maybe sesmimprom what am i going to do on a break sesmimprof get out of town or something i mean you need you need to clear your head cause you seem like youre really frustrated about it i mean you need to like be excited about youre doing rather than you know upset sesmimprom right thanks for talking to me sesmimprom hi um sesmimprof hi can i help you sesmimprom it seems that uh mymy bag didnt make it out on the carousel sesmimprof oh did you check did you make sure as it went around the second time that it sesmimprom yes yes its gone around like you know twenty times its been about a half hour sesmimprof okay well um the f sesmimprof actually im looking here at the information the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage it looks like a few peoples bags didnt make it through um so sesmimprom okay so whatwhat do i have to get you know sesmimprof well you can fill out this paperwork um and if for some reason it shows up we can bring it to you but sesmimprom for some reason so you think it wont show up sesmimprof well sometimes its just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just im reading off of this that sesmimprof uh it didnt make it into the second plane so it looks like there they dont actually know what happened to it sesmimprom what what how does that happen sesmimprof um well sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane uh there can be a theft or uh some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something sesmimprom i really i really need that bag sesmimprof i i i understand but um sesmimprom there are i have important things in that bag ive got sesmimprof okay sesmimprom i mean ive been away for a while and and now ive ive gifts for for you know friends and family i mean i got stuff in the there sesmimprof right sesmimprom its worth a lot sesmimprof i understand that um so im going to put down here that you looking for your baggage but we actually cant uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what were going to do sesmimprom not going to show well isnt like wouldnt it just be at the airport that like if it didnt get on the other plane sesmimprom can they check there sesmimprof sometimes it gets stolen sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and sesmimprom on another sesmimprof they they it gets shipped to somewhere else and then its stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that sesmimprof so well what well do sesmimprom but we have the tags on i mean like it wouldnt you know if it got stuck somewhere its like well this is nobodies bag i mean maybe you know look on the tag and sesmimprom see where it came from originally i mean it seems like sesmimprof right like i said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reimreimburse you sesmimprom theft sesmimprof um so sesmimprom theft dont you know like all these people that are work you keep like an eye on them how can they get away with sesmimprof we have very tight security but we uh there are times when we just cant uh make sure there arent absolutely no human error you know sesmimprof im sorry there is no guarantee on baggage sesmimprom this is unbelievable ive got sesmimprom you dont realize the stuff that ive got in that i really need to get the suitcase okay sesmimprof i understand so sesmimprom so if its back there or something if there is something you can do sesmimprom i need you to tell me because i really need to get the bag okay sesmimprof all right weve already checked back here for your baggage sesmimprof and we will continue to look for it and because your paper sesmimprom youve already checked can you check again garbage sesmimprof ive already looked thank you very much and because weve filled out paperwork if it shows up we will send it to you but otherwise what we can do is reimburse you for fifty dollar sesmimprom fifty fifty dollars come on you have got to be joking sesmimprof well its its just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than sesmimprom uh huh yea lost some of my possessions yes so if i lost maybe a shoe that was in the suitcase and like a carryon sesmimprom that might be like fifty dollars okay but this i garbage i had like thousands of dollars worth of stuff in that suitcase sesmimprof the airline cant afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase and so sesmimprom the a what talking about a core they cant afford it i mean sesmimprof well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we dont want to have false claims or anything like that so we have sesmimprof we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it to compensate and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely more than likely sesmimprom i mean youre not helping me here what do i have to do here do i need to sue the airline company is that what i should do sesmimprom because this is ridiculous sesmimprof im sorry i dont i sesmimprof i dont believe you should sue the airline company but we do have a policy uh in which we can reimburse you and thats all we can do and im sorry ive done everything i can sesmimprom all right im sick im sick of this all right im sick of you and keep your fifty dollar sesmimprof theres other people waiting sesmimprof fine sesmimprof whats going on sesmimprom kathy died last night sesmimprof oh my god oh my god im so sorry sesmimprom yeah i mean you know it was a sesmimprom i guess we saw it coming and she lasted a lot a lot longer than uh they expected but you know i mean when it actually happens its just a lot harder sesmimprof it doesnt make any easier yes sesmimprom i mean at least she was home she wasnt in the hospital anymore sesmimprof oh man im so sorry sesmimprom she was with yeah she was with gary and he said that she was just sitting there and went to sleep closed her eyes and that was it sesmimprof its going to be so rough im sorry sesmimprom yes i mean its not as rough on me as it is on him but sesmimprom god its you know weve spent so much time with them its just really surreal really weird that were not going to be able to see her anymore and go sesmimprof yeah sesmimprom out to out to dinner you know and do the troops to california i mean sesmimprof totally sesmimprom its just that i dont know its sort its sort of a weird thing you know sesmimprof yeah sesmimprom not being able to see anyone again who knows where they really went you know i mean

sesmscriptm he was out here when it broke sesmscriptf when sesmscriptm about four this morning i heard it cracking and i woke up and looked out he was standing right here when it cracked sesmscriptf what was he doing out here at four in the morning sesmscriptm i dont know when it cracked he ran into the house and cried in the kitchen sesmscriptf so you talked to him sesmscriptm no i figured it was best to leave him alone sesmscriptf he cried hard sesmscriptm i could hear him right through the floor in my room sesmscriptf what was he doing out here at that hour hes dreaming about him again hes walking around at night sesmscriptm i guess he is sesmscriptf hes getting just like after he died what is the meaning of that sesmscriptm i dont know the meaning of it but i know one thing mom weve made a terrible mistake with dad sesmscriptf what sesmscriptm being dishonest with him i mean that sort of thing always pays off and now its paying off sesmscriptf what do you mean dishonest sesmscriptm you know that larry is not coming back and i know it why do we allow him to go on thinking that we believe with him sesmscriptf what do you want to do argue with him sesmscriptm no i dont want to argue with him but its about time he realized that nobody believes larry is alive anymore sesmscriptm why why shouldnt he dream of him walk around waiting for him at night i mean do we contradict him do we say straight out that we dont have any hope anymore that we havent had hope for years now sesmscriptf you cant say that to him sesmscriptm weve got to say it to him sesmscriptf can you prove it how can you prove it sesmscriptm for god sakes its been three years nobody comes back after three years thats insane sesmscriptf to you it is and to me you can talk yourself blue in the face but there is no body and no grave so where are you sesmscriptm sit down mom i want to talk to you sesmscriptf the trouble is the god damned newspapers every month or so a boy turns up out of nowhere so the next one is going to be larry sesmscriptm all right all right listen to me sesmscriptm you know why i brought annie here dont you f why sesmscriptm you know sesmscriptf i got an idea

just saying sesmscriptm sometimes you infuriate me you know that isnt it your business to if i tell dad and he throws a fit about it you have such a talent for ignoring things sesmscriptf i ignore what i got to ignore the girl is larrys girl sesmscriptm shes not larrys girl sesmscriptf from fathers point of you he isnt dead and you have no right to take his girl sesmscriptf you can go on from there if you know where to go but i dont know where to go see i dont know so what can i do for you sesmscriptm i dont know why but every time i reach out for something that i really want i have to pull back cause someone else will suffer my whole bloody life time after time after time sesmscriptf youre a considerate fellow theres nothing wrong with that sesmscriptm to hell with that sesmscriptf have you asked annie yet sesmscriptm i wanted to get this settled first sesmscriptf how do you know shell marry you maybe she feels the same way your father does sesmscriptm well if she does then

women you never did sesmscriptm so what im not fast with women sesmscriptf i just dont see why it has to be annie sesmscriptm because it is sesmscriptf thats a good answer but it doesnt answer anything i mean you havent seen her since you went away to war its five years sesmscriptm i cant help it i know her best i mean lived next door to her my whole life these years when i think of a wife

going to happen to your father because i dont see sesmscriptm all right all right mom sesmscriptf just give it some more thought sesmscriptm ive given it three years of thought i thought that if i

sesmscriptm ill get out ill get married and go live some place else maybe new york sesmscriptf what the hell is this are you crazy sesmscriptm ive been a good son too long a good sucker im through

youve been kind of um sesmscriptm what sesmscriptf well kind of embarrassed ever since i got here sesmscriptm the trouble is i planned on sort of sneaking up on you on a period of a week or so but they take it for granted that were all set sesmscriptf i knew they would your mother anyway sesmscriptm howd you know sesmscriptf well from her point of view why else would i come sesmscriptm oh would you want to i guess you know this is why i asked you to come sesmscriptf i guess this is why i came sesmscriptm ann i love you i love you a great deal i love you sesmscriptm i have no imagination thats all i know to tell you sesmscriptm im embarrassing you and i didnt want to tell it to you here i wanted some place wed never been before a place where wed be brand new to each other sesmscriptm you feel wrong here dont you this yard this chair i want you to be ready for me i dont want to have to win you away from anything sesmscriptf oh chris ive been ready for a long long time sesmscriptm and hes gone forever youre sure sesmscriptf i almost got married two years ago sesmscriptm why didnt you sesmscriptf well you started to write me sesmscriptm you felt something that far back sesmscriptf every day since sesmscriptm ann why didnt you let me know sesmscriptf well i was waiting for you i mean till then you never wrote and when you did what did you say i mean you can sure be ambiguous sometimes you know sesmscriptm give me a kiss anne give me a sesmscriptm god i kissed annie how longhow long ive been waiting to kiss you sesmscriptf ill never forgive you why did you wait all these years i mean all i did was sit and wonder if i was crazy for thinking of you sesmscriptm oh annie were gonna live now im gonna make you so happy sesmscriptf not like that youre not sesmscriptm i kissed you sesmscriptf like larrys brother do it like you chris what is it sesmscriptm lets drive someplace i want to be alone with you sesmscriptf no what is it chris your mother sesmscriptm no nothing like that sesmscriptf well whats wrong i mean even in your letters there was somesomething ashamed sesmscriptm yeah i suppose i have been but its going from me sesmscriptf youve gotta tell me sesmscriptm i dont know how to start sesmscriptf it wouldnt work this way sesmscriptm its all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in charge of a company sesmscriptf yeah sure sesmscriptm well i lost them sesmscriptf how many sesmscriptm just about all sesmscriptf gee sesmscriptm it takes some time for a guy to toss that off cause they werent just men sesmscriptm for instance this one time it had been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks i put them in pocket its only a little thing but those are the kind of guys i had sesmscriptm they didnt die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly i mean a little more selfish and theyd have been here today sesmscriptm i got this idea watching em go down everything was being destroyed see but it seemed that one new thing was made a sort of responsibility man for man you know what i mean sesmscriptm to show that to bring that onto the earth again like some kind of monument and everyone can feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him sesmscriptm then i came back and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here i mean the whole thing to them seemed like its sort of a bus accident i went to work with dad and that rat race again sesmscriptm and i felt what you said ashamed somehow cause nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book drive the new car see the new refrigerator sesmscriptm i mean you can take those things out of a war but when you drive that car youve gotta realize that it came out of the love a man can have for a man youve gotta be a little better because of it sesmscriptm otherwise all you have is really loot and theres blood on it and i didnt want to take any of that and i guess that included you sesmscriptf do you still feel that way sesmscriptm i want you now annie sesmscriptf cause you mustnt feel that way because you have a right to everything you have chris everything you understand that me too sesmscriptf i mean and your money theres theres nothing wrong with your money i mean your father put hundreds of planes in the air a man should be paid for that sesmscriptm i know annie im gonna make a fortune for you sesmscriptf whatll i do with a fortune sesmscriptm what time is it theyre supposed to run around midnight sesmscriptm god this great isnt it like look at the night we go here it couldnt be better sesmscriptm i would have wanted to go a little further up the coast get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid wed miss it sesmscriptm how you doing sesmscriptf fine sesmscriptm is that is that no was that just foam i cant even tell sesmscriptm although i guess you cant tell it probably isnt them probably be unmistakable dont you think sesmscriptm how you doing you know what i forgot i forgot to bring my flashlight how how could i forget to bring my flashlight how could i be so stupid sesmscriptf what flashlight sesmscriptm you know the flashlight the silver one there is only one isnt there sesmscriptf thats not your flashlight sesmscriptm whos is it sesmscriptf its ours its mine too sesmscriptm oh well sure yes sesmscriptf but you kept saying my flashlight as if somehow its just yours i mean how is it supposed to make me feel sesmscriptm no no of course our flashlight yours and mine mi flashlight es su flashlight naturally sesmscriptm how could we forget to bring it i hope the moon stays out sesmscriptm i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cant remember if it was full last year do you remember sesmscriptf yea sesmscriptm you cold you want my jacket we shouldve we shouldve brought our blanket our blanket how could we forget to bring the blanket sesmscriptm oh a sixpack thats shouldve brought a a sixpack be just the ticket right now how could i forget sesmscriptm oh man like a kid its amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped sesmscriptm you think they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around sesmscriptf im cold sesmscriptm what you want my jacket sesmscriptf its after eleven lets just go home sesmscriptm are you kidding wed miss it we we just got here whats the point in coming down here if we just turn around and go home sesmscriptf there is no point in coming down here sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf thats my point sesmscriptm thats my point too sesmscriptf so lets go sesmscriptm no no thats not my point the point is there is no point in coming down here if we just leave dont you want to see it sesmscriptf not particularly sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf i dont its just stupid sesmscriptm honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean it only happens once a year sesmscriptm think about the people in kansas they theyd have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservations to see this we live forty minutes away its too good to pass up sesmscriptf pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and swim away and then they die sesmscriptm yea but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives i mean all that flopping is laying eggs or what do you mating or spotting or something like that sesmscriptm this is a big night for these guys lifes last orgy sesmscriptf what are you so excited about i mean its not a moon landing were talking about here its fish its a fish nobody even eats sesmscriptm yes they do sesmscriptf augie sesmscriptm okay but its fish that do something none of the other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs sesmscriptm you know there is like there is a certain mystery here a magic a bit of the unexplainable i dont see how you cannot be interested sesmscriptf im just not sesmscriptm for real sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm i dont get it the first time we came here you said it was the best night of your life sesmscriptm and then last year i remember specifically you were so excited that you stubbed your toe on the way pushing me out of the house and you didnt even notice until we got in the car sesmscriptf last year youll also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties you got a sore throat we got into a big fight over nothing and we didnt see the grunions sesmscriptm we werent in a good spot sesmscriptf we didnt see them the first time either sesmscriptm we just werent in a good spot this is a much better spot ive got good instincts for these things sesmscriptm there is that oh no thats just seaweed isnt it sesmscriptm this is this is great isnt it i wouldnt miss this for anything now listen to this i know youre not interested but just listen sesmscriptm out there somewhere there is this huge mass of silver fish headed this way sesmscriptm they dont why we dont know why they didnt take a vote or anything they didnt get a map or an invitation sesmscriptm just all as one this little time sensitive firecracker instinctual firecracker in their body just went off and all as one they turned and formed a line as long the california coast and started swimming theyre swimming right now as if thats the only thing that matters sesmscriptm its single mindedness with no mind its urgency thats pure urge they dont know what drives them they dont ask it a name or ask it a question sesmscriptm they just turn as one and start the swim and brings them right here to this spot where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death sesmscriptm look at me im giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up sesmscriptf thats the wind sesmscriptm well so what do you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm what i was saying sesmscriptf its ridiculous sesmscriptm so what do you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm what i was saying sesmscriptf its ridiculous sesmscriptm certainly its not slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesmscriptf its pr someone sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach sesmscriptm well im not the only one look at all these people sesmscriptf yea sure everyone was sold the same story i mean it keeps us all excited keeps us coming back for more keeps us thinking that life is going to start any second now if we can just get in on the action and find the right spot sesmscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesmscriptf im sorry but its still just fish to me sesmscriptm carla can i ask you something dont take this wrong but are you having your period sesmscriptf goddamn it augie dont ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that its insulting sesmscriptm well whats bugging you sesmscriptf we just have different ideas of what this evening is supposed to look like sesmscriptm there is nothing to it we come here the grunion arrive then do their little fish business we go oh ah look they go home we go home sesmscriptf for heavens sake we are not going to see the grunions sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf we never do do we i mean have we ever sesmscriptm weve missed them twice thats not ever sesmscriptf twice is every time weve tried thats ever sesmscriptm well well see them this year sesmscriptf no we wont its pointless its like waiting up to see santa claus sesmscriptf i mean i feel like my whole life is going to be spent standing on the beach waiting for the fish to show up with my eyes open and my hands clasped expectantly and the fish wont show up sesmscriptm i thought you wanted to see them sesmscriptf you dont understand anything im saying sesmscriptm no of course not sesmscriptf i did want to see them i always do i mean i keep thinking that this is going to be the time and it never is sesmscriptm its just fish i mean nothing to get traumatized over sesmscriptf for heavens sake this isnt about fish sesmscriptm all right ive been trying to work this backwards but i cannot seem to pinpoint the moment that we took a turn for the worst sesmscriptm you were fine during the phone call from marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem lets see i took a shower you watched the news you said sesmscriptm the grunion are running tonight i said great lets go i feel lucky sesmscriptm okay so im getting on my jacket and putting out the animals getting the car out of the garage sesmscriptf do you remember the first time we came to see it it was about four years ago right after we got married sesmscriptf we thought i was pregnant and we opened a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance we kicked off our shoes and you popped the cork sesmscriptf and when we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ears so i could feel them as much as hear them sesmscriptf and i remember thinking that this is it you know at last at last i am as happy as i am supposed to be sesmscriptm wait a minute ive got it sesmscriptf just dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle sesmscriptm it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said lets get some champagne and i said times are wasting or something like that right sesmscriptm of course i see it now you want this to be like that other time right thats it right sesmscriptf id rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things sesmscriptm yea okay sure no i see listen you want to dance sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm you want to go get some champagne sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm take off our shoes sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm what you want me to breathe in your ear sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm get married again sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm what what you want a divorce sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm a vacation sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm a new carpet a poodle a ice cream backrub a suicide pact what what carla what the hell do you want f no sesmscriptf i want something to turn out the way that it supposed to sesmscriptm well welcome to the human race all right do you think this is what i had in mind when i proposed you think i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road wed come to the beach and yell at each other over fish sesmscriptm you think i knew that there be times when youd look at me like im a used kleenex or that id look at you and think holy hell when is the next flight to alaska sesmscriptm no no just like you i thought it was going to be all like peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and well have three fat rosy kids and haha baby the joke is on us sesmscriptm cause you know what you get carla you know what you get this sesmscriptf this what what is this this isnt even anything sesmscriptm yes it is sesmscriptf im sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf well but this isnt anything like i thought anything would be like sesmscriptm no i know me neither sesmscriptf i mean its this is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything but isnt something else do you have any idea what im trying to say sesmscriptm im doing the best i can sesmscriptf i know that augie really i do sesmscriptf i know that you meant this to be special and nice and theres the sand and the moon and everything but i just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else sesmscriptm maybe if you were with somebody else too sesmscriptf i didnt say that sesmscriptm no i know but still i know i dont make you happy sesmscriptf for heavens sake whatever im doing id rather be doing it with you sesmscriptm yeah sesmscriptf dont be ridiculous i mean dont you know that sesmscriptf youre the one who probably wishes he was with someone else someone who knew how to enjoy herself and didnt take everything so hard sesmscriptm now that you mention it no i dont sesmscriptf okay fine so were in the wrong spot but were with the right person sesmscriptm i dont know it seemed like a pretty good spot to me look at the moon view the moon view i got from here sesmscriptf yes i noticed that it looks pretty on the water doesnt it big old white moon sesmscriptm what have we got here sesmscriptf augie you brought refreshments sesmscriptm its not champagne sesmscriptf well i guess we dont need glasses sesmscriptm you still cold do you want my jacket do you want to go home sesmscriptf no no i think you might be right i think

sesmscriptf oh it sends shivers down my spine sesmscriptm what do we do if they suddenly walk in on us sesmscriptf behave exquisitely sesmscriptm with the most perfect poise sesmscriptf yes i should probably to a court curtsey sesmscriptm things that ought to matter dreadfully dont matter at all when ones is happy do they sesmscriptf whats so horrible is that one cant stay happy sesmscriptm oh darling dont say that sesmscriptf its true the whole business is a very poor joke sesmscriptm meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love sesmscriptf yes meaning just that sesmscriptm what does it all mean thats what i ask thats what i ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth good god what does it all mean sesmscriptf dont laugh at me im serious sesmscriptm you mustnt be serious my dear one thats just what they want sesmscriptf whos they sesmscriptm all those futile moralists who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths sesmscriptm flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness in light sesmscriptf well if i laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too sesmscriptm certainly you must we figures of fun all right sesmscriptf well shall we always want to bicker and fight sesmscriptm no that desire will fade along with our passion sesmscriptf oh dear should we like that sesmscriptm depends on how well we play it sesmscriptf well what happens if one of us dies does the one thats left still laugh sesmscriptm yes yes with all his might sesmscriptf well thats serious enough isnt it sesmscriptm no no it isnt death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors sesmscriptf darling i believe youre talking nonsense sesmscriptm so is everyone else in the long run sesmscriptm lets be superficial and pity the poor philosophers lets blow our trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like quite idiotic very small school children lets savor the delight of the moment sesmscriptm come kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets sesmscriptf elliot worms dont pop sesmscriptm i dont care what you do see you can paint yourself green and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shant say a word as long as you love me best sesmscriptf thank you dear the same applies you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman ill kill you sesmscriptm you remember that awful scene we had in venice sesmscriptf which particular one sesmscriptm the one when you bought that little painted wooden snake in the piazza and put it on my bed sesmscriptf oh charles that was his name charles it did wiggle so beautifully sesmscriptm horrible thing i hated it sesmscriptf i know you did you threw it out of the window into the grand canal i dont think ill ever forgive you for that sesmscriptm how long did that row last sesmscriptf it went on intermittently for days sesmscriptm the worst one was in cannes when your curling iron burned a hole in my new dressing gown sesmscriptf it burned my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom sesmscriptm that was a rouser wasnt it sesmscriptf that was the first time you ever hit me sesmscriptm i didnt hit you very hard sesmscriptf the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers sesmscriptm ill never forget his face sesmscriptf oh it was ridiculous completely ridiculous sesmscriptm we were very much younger then sesmscriptf and very much sillier sesmscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesmscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesmscriptf you knew there was nothing in that sesmscriptm i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him sesmscriptf presents just a trivial little broach sesmscriptm yes i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste sesmscriptf no it wasnt it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often sesmscriptm you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden sesmscriptf no i didnt you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination sesmscriptm you must admit he was in love with you wasnt he sesmscriptf just a little perhaps nothing serious sesmscriptm you let him kiss you you said you did sesmscriptf what of it sesmscriptm what of it sesmscriptf it gave him a lot of pleasure it didnt hurt me any sesmscriptm what about me sesmscriptf well if you hadnt been so nosey and suspicious you never wouldnt have known anything about it sesmscriptm thats a nice point of view i must say sesmscriptf im bored of this conversation sesmscriptm yes me too bored stiff you want some brandy sesmscriptf no thanks sesmscriptm i have a little i think sesmscriptf i dont see why you want any youve already had two glasses sesmscriptm no particular reason anyhow they are very small ones sesmscriptf it just seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing sesmscriptm you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on sesmscriptf well its become a habit with you sesmscriptm you neednt be so grand just because dont happen want any yourself right now sesmscriptf dont be so stupid sesmscriptm really amanda sesmscriptf what sesmscriptm nothing sesmscriptf no im just making myself fascinating for you sesmscriptm going out somewhere dear sesmscriptf its a womans job to allure the man sesmscriptm that reply has broken my heart sesmscriptf watch me a minute will you sesmscriptm as a matter of fact thats perfectly true sesmscriptf oh no it isnt sesmscriptm yes it is sesmscriptf be quiet sesmscriptm its a pity you didnt have any more brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable sesmscriptf it doesnt seem to work such wonders with you sesmscriptm snap snap snap like a little adder sesmscriptf adders dont snap they sting sesmscriptm oh nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap sesmscriptf they sting sesmscriptm they snap sesmscriptf i dont care do you understand i dont care i dont care if they bark or roll about like hoops sesmscriptm tell me did you see much of peter burden after our divorce sesmscriptf yes i did quite a lot sesmscriptm i imagine you let him kiss you good deal more then sesmscriptf mind your own business sesmscriptm what riotous time you must have had sesmscriptm no restraint at all very enjoyable never had much anyhow sesmscriptf youre quite insufferable i expect its because youre drunk sesmscriptm i am not in the least drunk sesmscriptm i imagine as i may have already mentioned ive had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldnt get drunk on that sesmscriptf on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy sesmscriptm oh very interesting how about a child of four a child of six or a child of nine sesmscriptf oh be quiet sesmscriptm we can get a good little debate going about that dont you think intemperate tots sesmscriptf not very funny my dear you better have some more brandy sesmscriptm all right i will sesmscriptm better turn that off i think sesmscriptf why sesmscriptm because its late and itll annoy the people upstairs sesmscriptf there arent any people upstairs its a photographers studio sesmscriptm there are people downstairs i suppose sesmscriptf theyre away in tunis sesmscriptm this is no time of the year for tunis sesmscriptf turn it on again please sesmscriptm ill do no such thing sesmscriptf very well if you insist on being boorish and idiotic sesmscriptm turn it off its driving me mad sesmscriptf you are far too temperamental try to control yourself sesmscriptm turn it off sesmscriptf stop it stop it i hate you sesmscriptm amanda listen listen sesmscriptf listen indeed im sick and tired of listening to you damn sadistic bully

sesfscriptf how many sesfscriptm just about all sesfscriptf geez sesfscriptm it takes a little while to toss that off because they werent just men sesfscriptm for instance one time it had to have been raining several days there was this one kid he came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket sesfscriptm i mean thatsthats only a little thing but thats the kind of guys i had they didnt just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly a little more selfish and theyd still be here today sesfscriptm and i and i thought something watching them go down sesfscriptm everything was being destroyed see but there was one new thing that was being created a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me sesfscriptm and to show thatto bring that onto the earth like some sort of monument standing right behind us where everyone could feel it and it would make a difference to him sesfscriptm and i came back here and it was incredible there was no meaning in that here the whole thing to them was a bus accident sesfscriptm and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you saidashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys sesfscriptm and i felt wrong to be alive to drive the car to see the new checkbook to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but you got to know that when you drive that car that that came out of the love a man can have for another man and you got to be a little bit better because of that sesfscriptm otherwise what you have here is loot and theres blood on it sesfscriptm and i didnt want to take any of it sesfscriptm and i guess that included you sesfscriptf and you still feel that way sesfscriptm i want you now annie sesfscriptf because you cant feel that way never again chris you hear me never i mean the money and me too sesfscriptf i mean theres nothing wrong in that money and your father put good planes up in the air and you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that sesfscriptm annie sesfscriptm annie im going to make a fortune for you sesfscriptf what am i going to do with a fortune sesfscriptm hey what time is it theyre supposed to run around midnight right god this is great isnt it sesfscriptm look at the night we got couldnt be better sesfscriptm you know

down here if we just turn around and leave sesfscriptm i mean dont you want to see it sesfscriptf not particularly sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf i dont know i just dont sesfscriptm honey this is a naturalthis is a natural phenomenon i mean it only happens once a year this is this is a great opportunity think about the people in kansas they would have to get a plane ticket and hotel reservation to come and see this were only forty minutes away this is too good to pass up sesfscriptf pass up what a bunch of fish they swim up to the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die sesfscriptm yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives and all that flopping around is laying eggs or what youspawning or mating or something like that sesfscriptm i mean this is the big night for these guys lifes last orgy sesfscriptf i dont know why youre getting so excited i mean its not like the landing of the moon or something its just fish fish that nobody eats sesfscriptm yeah they do sesfscriptf oh god augie sesfscriptm what okay then its fish that do something no other fish do like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings who throw themselves off the cliffs sesfscriptm theres magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable i mean i dont see how you cannot be interested sesfscriptf im just not i mean im sorry it justtheyre still fish to me sesfscriptm for real sesfscriptf yes sesfscriptm i dont get it the last timethe first time that we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life sesfscriptm and then last year when we came to see it you ran out of the house so fast that you stubbed your toe and you didnt even notice until you got in the car sesfscriptf yes and if you also remember i got sand in my panties we got into an argument about nothing you got a sore throat and we never saw the grunions sesfscriptm we werent in a good spot sesfscriptf no for gods sakes weve never seen the grunions were not going to see them sesfscriptm we just werent in a good spot all right this is a much better spot i have a good instinct for these things look is that sesfscriptm no thats just seaweed isnt it this is great isnt it sesfscriptm i wouldnt miss this for anything i mean think about this okay i know youre not interested but just think about this for a minute sesfscriptm somewhere out there theres this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they dont know why and we dont know why just some little instinctual timerelease firecracker went offwent off in their bodies sesfscriptm and they all all as one turned as one and formed this line as big as the california coast and started swimming this way swimming as if thats the only thing that matters sesfscriptm you know they didnt ask it a question they didnt they didnt take a vote they didnt have an invitation or a map they just started swimming as one sesfscriptm its singlemindedness with one mind urgency thats pure urge you know they dont give it a name sesfscriptm they dont ask it a question they just they just they dont know what drives them they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them to here sesfscriptm where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh god im giving myself goosebumps look im allall my hairs on my arms is sticking up sesfscriptf yeah thats the wind sesfscriptm so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm about what i just said sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm about what i was just saying sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm it certainly is not it is slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesfscriptf its so pr i mean somebodys giving you a good bill about this wonderful event thats going to happen on the beach sesfscriptm well im not the only one look at all these people sesfscriptf exactly everyone else is told the same thing it keeps them feeling excited keeps them coming back keeps them thinking lifes

sesfscriptf its impossible its like waiting around waiting to see santa claus you know sesfscriptf like i feel like my whole life ive been just standing on this beach with my hands clasped waiting for these fish to show up and these fish never show up sesfscriptm god i thought you wanted to see it sesfscriptf i do sesfscriptf look i did i always do but its like every time i try nothing ever happens sesfscriptm its just fish nothing to get traumatized over sesfscriptf for gods sake augie this is not about fish sesfscriptm ive been turning this thing over in my head trying to figure out when the point was when we took a turn for the worse and i cant seem to pinpoint it sesfscriptm you were fine during the phone call from marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem lets see i took a shower you were watching the news you said augie i think the grunion are running i said great lets go i feel lucky tonight sesfscriptm and so im getting the animals putting the animals out in the yard

sesmscriptm oh annie i love you i love you a great deal sesmscriptm i love you sesmscriptf i guess thats why i came sesmscriptm i donti have no imagination thats the only way i know how to tell it

sesmscriptm oh god annie i kissed annie i kissed annie sesmscriptf ill never forgive you for that sesmscriptm how long how long ive been waiting to do that sesmscriptf i mean why did you wait all these years there i was sitting around and wondering if i was crazy for thinking about you sesmscriptm were going to live now im going to make you so happy sesmscriptf not like that youre not sesmscriptm i kissed you sesmscriptf like larrys brother do it like you chris sesmscriptm nothing hey lets drive somewhere i want to be alone with you sesmscriptf what is it sesmscriptf no what is it your mother sesmscriptm no nothing nothing like that sesmscriptf tell me whats wrong i mean even in your letters you seemed ashamed sesmscriptm well yes i guess ive been ashamed but its going from me sesmscriptf you got to tell me sesmscriptm i dont know where to start sesmscriptf okay it wouldnt work like this sesmscriptm you remember overseas i was in command of a company sesmscriptf yeah sure sesmscriptm well i lost them sesmscriptf how many sesmscriptm just about all sesmscriptf geez sesmscriptm takes a little while to toss that off cause they werent just men sesmscriptm for instance one time thisit had been raining several days and this one kid he came up to me he gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket sesmscriptm thats just a little thing but thats the kind of guys i had they didnt just die they killed themselves for each other and i mean that exactly sesmscriptm a little more selfish and theyd still be here today and i got this idea watching them go down see everything was being destroyed but there was one new thing that was being created sesmscriptm it was a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me sesmscriptm and to show that and to bring that onto the earth again like some sort of monument standing right behind all of us and we could feel it and it would make a difference to him sesmscriptm and then i came here and it was incredible there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was a kind of bus accident sesmscriptm and i went to work with dad and that rat race again and i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody was changed at all sesmscriptm it seemed to make a sucker out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive i felt wrong to have that new checkbook sesmscriptm open that new bank account drive the new car and see the new refrigerator sesmscriptm cause you can take those things out of the war but you got to know when you drive that car that it came out of the love that a man can have for a man and you got to be a little bit better because of that sesmscriptm otherwise what you have is loot and theres blood on it sesmscriptm and i didnt want to take any of it and i guess that included you sesmscriptf and you still feel that way sesmscriptm i want you now annie sesmscriptf cause you must not feel that way again you hear me you cant you deserve everything you have chris sesmscriptf that includes me too i mean and the money you have right to that money your father put planes up in the air good planes and he deserves it you should be proud of that a man should be paid for that sesmscriptm garbage annie sesmscriptm annie im going to make a fortune for you sesmscriptf what am i going to do with a fortune sesmscriptm buy some hats sesmscriptm hey what time is it this pokes around midnight right god this is great isnt it sesmscriptm look at the night we got i wouldnt trade this for anything sesmscriptm you know actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast and get away from all the lights and people but i was afraid youd miss it how are you doing sesmscriptf fine sesmscriptm is that is that nah is that just paul i cant even tell sesmscriptm but if i cant tell it probably isnt them isnt it probably would be unmistakable wouldnt you think how are you doing sesmscriptm oh you know what i forgot i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid i shouldve brought my flashlight sesmscriptf what flashlight sesmscriptm you know the flashlight the silver one theres only one isnt there sesmscriptf its not your flashlight sesmscriptm well whose is it sesmscriptf its ours mine too sesmscriptm well sure sesmscriptf well you keep saying its my flashlight like its only your flashlight i mean how do you think that makes me feel sesmscriptm no of course our flashlight yours and mine me flashlight is su flashlight naturally sesmscriptm how could we have not thought to bring it i hope the moon stays out sesmscriptm was it a full moon last year when they were running i cant remember do you remember sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm are you cold do you want my jacket sesmscriptm we shouldve brought the blanket our blanket sesmscriptm god oh you know what would be good right about now a sixpack a sixpack would be just the ticket sesmscriptm im so stupid i shouldve brought a sixpack god im like a little kid its amazing i get out of the house with my fly zipped up oh laughter sesmscriptm i wonder if they can hear us talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around sesmscriptf look im cold sesmscriptm do you want my jacket sesmscriptf its past eleven lets go sesmscriptm what are you kidding me we just got here we miss it whats the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home sesmscriptf there is no point in coming down here sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf thats my point sesmscriptm thats my point toono no thats not my point my point is whats the point if we come down here if we just turn around and leave sesmscriptf so lets go sesmscriptm i mean dont you want to see it sesmscriptf not particularly sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf i dont know i just dont sesmscriptm honey this is a natural phenomenon it only happens once a year i mean think about the people in kansas they would have to get hotel reservations and plane tickets to come and see this were only forty minutes away this is too good to pass up sesmscriptf pass up what these fish swim up to shore on the beach and then they flop around a little they swim away and then they die sesmscriptm well this is like the highlight the one night of their lives and that flopping around thats laying eggs or spawning or mating or whatever you call it sesmscriptm but this is the big night for these guys their last lifes last orgy sesmscriptf what are you getting so excited about i mean its not like its like the landing on the moon or something i mean its just fish fish that nobody eats sesmscriptm yeah they do sesmscriptf augie sesmscriptm okay but its fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows in capistrano or the lemmings that throw themselves off the cliffs theres magic here and some mystery and a little bit of unexplainable sesmscriptm i mean i cant see how you can not be interested sesmscriptf im just not sesmscriptm for real sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm i dont get it i mean the first time we came to see it you said it was the best night of your life sesmscriptm and last year when we came you ran out of the house so fast you stubbed your toe and you didnt even notice it until we got in the car sesmscriptf you also could remember that i got sand in my panties we got in an argument over nothing you got a sore throat and we didnt even get to see the grunions sesmscriptm okay were in a good spot sesmscriptf you didnt see them the first time either sesmscriptm we just werent in the good spot this is a much better spot you know i have a good instincts for these things sesmscriptm look is thatno is that just seaweed sesmscriptm you know this is great isnt it you know i wouldnt trade this for anything sesmscriptm i mean think about this i know youre not interested but just think about this for a minute sesmscriptm somewhere out there theres this huge silver mass of fish heading this way they dont why we dont know why they just some little instinctual fire cracker went off in their bodies sesmscriptm like and they all just turned at once and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming this way they didnt you know they didnt make a decision they didnt you know have boats or anything no one sent them an invitation or a map they just started swimming as if thats the only thing that matters sesmscriptm its single mindedness with no mind its urgency thats pure urge and they dont they dont ask it a question they dont give it a name they just swim sesmscriptm they just start swimming to this place right here where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death sesmscriptm oh im giving myself goose bumps look all my hairs are standing up sesmscriptf thats the wind sesmscriptm breathing so what do you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm about what i just said sesmscriptf its ridiculous sesmscriptm it certainly is not its sesmscriptm so what do you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm about what i just said sesmscriptf its ridiculous

bugging you then sesmscriptf look its pointless itswere not going to see the grunions i mean its like waiting around to see santa claus you know its sesmscriptf listen ive waiting my entire life on this beach just standing there waiting for this fish to show up and these fish never show up sesmscriptm i thought you wanted to see it sesmscriptf god you dont understand anything sesmscriptm no of

dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem sesmscriptm lets see i took a shower you were watching the news you said hey hey the grunions are running tonight and i said great lets go i feel lucky tonight sesmscriptm and then im putting the animals out in the yard im pulling the car out of the garage putting my jacket on sesmscriptf look do you remember the first time we came here sesmscriptf we thought i was pregnant sesmscriptf we brought a bottle of champagne and we took off our shoes and danced barefoot in the sand sesmscriptf under the moon and you whispered so softly into my ear so i could feel your words sesmscriptf and i thought this is it this is how happy im supposed to be sesmscriptm wait a minute ive got it sesmscriptf what dancing barefoot in the sand drinking out of a bottle of champagne sesmscriptm it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker sesmscriptm and you said lets get some champagne and i said times a wasting or something like that sesmscriptm you want this to be like the other time right thats it right sesmscriptf id rather not remember something sesmscriptf rather not hope for something sesmscriptm okay right i got it sure of course listen do you want to dance sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm do you want me to get some champagne sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm take off our shoes sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm what do you want me to

what i had in mind that four years down the line that wed get married and come to the beach and argue with each other over fish no sesmscriptm i was just like you i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and everything great and the sand in our toes and the wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will pay themselves and wed have three big fat rosy kids sesmscriptm and you know baby the jokes on us because you know what you get do you know what you get carla you get this sesmscriptf this whatwhats this this isnt anything alright sure standing on the beach fighting and waiting sesmscriptm yes it is sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf cause everything isnt anything like i thought it would be sesmscriptm no i know me neither sesmscriptf this is just this

sesmscriptm it seemed like a good spot to me sesmscriptm i mean look at the view of the moon we got from here sesmscriptf yeah i noticed that its real pretty on the water sesmscriptf big old white moon sesmscriptm hey look what we got here sesmscriptf oh you brought refreshments sesmscriptm its not champagne sesmscriptf well at least we wont need glasses sesmscriptm are you still cold do you

and light sesmscriptf so if im to laugh at everything then i must laugh at us too sesmscriptm oh certainly you must were figures of fun alright sesmscriptf how long will it last this ludicrous overbearing love of ours sesmscriptm who knows sesmscriptf shall we always want to bicker and fight sesmscriptm no that fire will fade along with our passion sesmscriptf well dear shall we want that sesmscriptm well it depends on how well weve played sesmscriptf what happens if one of us dies i mean does the other one still laugh sesmscriptm of course yes yes with all his might sesmscriptf thats serious enough sesmscriptm no no it isnt thats very laughable a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors sesmscriptf darling i believe youre talking nonsense sesmscriptm oh and who isnt talking

his face oohrah laughter sesmscriptf how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous sesmscriptm we were very much younger then sesmscriptf and much sillier too sesmscriptm the real cause of that rile

and i wear it often sesmscriptm you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden sesmscriptf no i didnt you made up the whole thing in your jealous imagination sesmscriptm you must admit he was in love with you sesmscriptf just a little perhaps but nothing serious sesmscriptm you let him kiss you you said so what of it sesmscriptf well what of it sesmscriptf well it didnt harm him in fact it pleasured him a lot and it didnt hurt me sesmscriptm and what about me sesmscriptf well if you hadnt been so suspicious and nosey you wouldve never known anything sesmscriptm oh thats a nice

the least bit drunk sesmscriptf youve always had a weak head sesmscriptm okay like i mentioned before i had three very small minute liquor glasses of brandy thats not even enough to get a child of two drunk sesmscriptf on the contrary a child of two can get violently drunk off just one glass of brandy sesmscriptm oh what an interesting topic what about a child of four and a child of six a child of nine sesmscriptf shut up sesmscriptm we might be able to bring up a splendid little debate about this intemperate tots sesmscriptf not very funny dear in fact maybe you better have some more brandy

man can have for a man youve got to be a little better because of that sesfscriptm otherwise what you have is really just loot and theres blood on it i didnt want to take any of it sesfscriptm i guess that included you sesfscriptf and do you still feel that way sesfscriptm i want you now annie sesfscriptf because you mustnt feel that way anymore because you have a right to whatever you have chris do you understand everything sesfscriptf that includes me and your money theres nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes in the air sesfscriptf you should be proud a man should be paid for that sesfscriptm annie annie im going to make a fortune for you sesfscriptf whatll i do with a fortune sesfscriptm what time is it theyre supposed to run around midnight this is great isnt

sesfscriptf its after eleven lets go home sesfscriptm are you kidding wed miss it we just got here whats the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home sesfscriptf there is no point in coming down here sesfscriptm right sesfscriptf thats my point sesfscriptm thats my point too sesfscriptf so lets go home sesfscriptm no no no thats not my point my point is is that theres no point in coming down here if we just leave dont you want to see it sesfscriptf not particularly sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf i just dont its stupid sesfscriptm honey this is natural phenomenon i mean this only happens once a year this is a great opportunity sesfscriptm think about the people in kansas theyd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this were just forty minutes away its too good to pass up sesfscriptf pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then swim away and then they die sesfscriptm yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that sesfscriptm this is the big night for these guys lifes last orgy sesfscriptf what are you so excited about this isnt a moon landing were talking about its fish its fish nobody even eats sesfscriptm yeah they do sesfscriptf oh augie sesfscriptm okay but its fish who do something none of the other fish do sesfscriptm like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that theres mystery here and magic sesfscriptm a little bit of the unexplainable i dont see how you cannot be interested sesfscriptf im just not sesfscriptm for real sesfscriptf yes sesfscriptm i dont get it the first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited to get here you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didnt even notice until we were in the car sesfscriptf last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we got in a big fight over nothing you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions sesfscriptm we werent in a good spot sesfscriptf we didnt see them the first time either sesfscriptm we just werent in a good spot this is a much better spot sesfscriptm ive got good instincts for these things look there whats that is that is that is thatno its just seaweed isnt it sesfscriptm ah man this is great i wouldnt miss this for anything i mean think about this i know youre not interested but just think about this for a minute sesfscriptm out there someplace theres this huge mass of silver fish heading this way they dont know why we dont know why it wasnt a decision they didnt take a vote sesfscriptm no one sent them a map or an invitation just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming sesfscriptm theyre swimming right now as if thats the only thing that matters sesfscriptm its single mindedness with no mind urgency thats pure urge sesfscriptm they dont know what drives them they dont give it a name or ask question they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place sesfscriptm where we stand for massive celebration of sex and death sesfscriptm ah im giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up sesfscriptf thats the wind sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm what i said sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm what i said sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm it certainly is not its slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesfscriptf its pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach sesfscriptm im not the only one look at these people sesfscriptf well sure everybodys told the same story it keeps us all coming back for more it keeps us all excited keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action sesfscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesfscriptf well im sorry but its still just fish to me sesfscriptm carla can i ask you something dont take this the wrong way but are you having your period sesfscriptf goddamn it augie dont ask me that you always ask me that i hate it when you ask me that its insulting sesfscriptm well then whats bugging you sesfscriptf we just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like sesfscriptm theres nothing to it we come down here the grunions arrive they do their little fish business we go oh ah look at the fish they go home we go home sesfscriptf for heavens sake this is not about fish sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf we totally skipped right sesfscriptm theres nothing to it we come down here the grunions arrive they do the little fish business we go oh ah look at the fish they go home we go home sesfscriptf for heavens sake grow up we are not going to see the grunions sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf we never do do we have we ever sesfscriptm weve missed them twice thats not ever sesfscriptf twice is every time weve tried thats ever sesfscriptm well see them this year sesfscriptf no we wont its pointless its like waiting up to see santa clause sesfscriptf god i feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up sesfscriptf and the fish wont show up sesfscriptm i thought you wanted to see it sesfscriptf you dont understand anything im saying sesfscriptm no of course not sesfscriptf i did want to see it i always do i keep thinking that this time will be the time but it never is sesfscriptm its just a fish nothing to get traumatized over sesfscriptf for heavens sake this is not about fish sesfscriptm ive been trying to work this backwards but i cant seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse you were fine during the phone call from marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem sesfscriptm lets see i took a shower you watched the news you said the grunions are running tonight i said great lets go i feel lucky tonight sesfscriptm okay uh so im putting on my jacket putting out the animals were getting the car out of the garage sesfscriptf do you remember the first time we came to see it it was about four years ago right after we got married sesfscriptf we thought i was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance so we took off our shoes sesfscriptf and you popped the cork and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me sesfscriptf right into my ear so that i could hear them as much as so that i could feel them as much as hear them sesfscriptf and i remember thinking this is it at last at last im as happy as im supposed to be sesfscriptm wait a minute ive got it sesfscriptf dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle sesfscriptm it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said lets get some champagne and i said times a wasting or something like that right sesfscriptm thats it right you want this to be like the other time right thats it sesfscriptf i would rather not remember some things i would rather not hope for some things sesfscriptm okay right i got it sure of course listen you want to dance sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm you want me to get some champagne sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm take off our shoes sesfscriptf no no sesfscriptm well what want me to breath in your ear sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm want to get married again sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm what what do you want a divorce sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm a vacation sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm a new carpet a poodle a backrub ice cream a suicide pact what what carla what the hell do you want sesfscriptf i want something to turn out the way its supposed to sesfscriptm well welcome to the human race you think this is what i had in mind sesfscriptm do you think that when i proposed i had this great fantasy going that four years down the line wed come to the beach and yell at each other over fish sesfscriptm do you think that i knew that thered be times when youd look at me like im a used kleenex and times i would look at you and think holy hell whens the next flight to alaska sesfscriptm no no im just like you i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and sand in our hair and wind in our sesfscriptm sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves and ha ha baby the jokes on us because you know what you get sesfscriptm you know what you get carla this sesfscriptf this what what is this this isnt even anything sesfscriptm yes it is sesfscriptf oh right sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting sesfscriptm right sesfscriptf but this isnt anything like i thought anything would be like sesfscriptm no i know me either sesfscriptf this is just this i mean it includes a lot in everything but its just not you know something else do you have any idea what im trying to say sesfscriptm im doing the best i can sesfscriptf i know you are augie really i do i know you wanted this to be special and nice and its the full moon and the sand and all but i just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else sesfscriptm maybe if you were with somebody else too sesfscriptf i didnt say that sesfscriptm no i know but still i know i dont make you happy sesfscriptf for heavens sake whatever im doing id rather be doing it with you sesfscriptm yeah sesfscriptf well dont be ridiculous dont you know that youre the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else sesfscriptf somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didnt take everything so hard sesfscriptm actually now that you mention it no i dont sesfscriptf okay fine so were in the wrong spot but were with the right person sesfscriptm i dont know it seemed like a good spot to me sesfscriptm i mean look at the view youve got of the moon from here sesfscriptf yeah i noticed that looks pretty on the water doesnt it big old white moon sesfscriptm well look at what we got here sesfscriptf oh augie you brought refreshments sesfscriptm its not champagne sesfscriptf well then i guess we dont need glasses sesfscriptm you still cold do you want to go home sesfscriptf im beginning to think you might be right i think this may be the spot after all augie im sorry sesfscriptm shh if were very quiet the fish might come sesfscriptf or not sesfscriptm or not sesfscriptm good god sesfscriptf do you think its them sesfscriptm i wonder sesfscriptf nobody knows were here except freda and she wouldnt ring up sesfscriptm it must be them then sesfscriptf well what are we going to do sesfscriptm well be alright darling whatever happens arent we sesfscriptf now and always sweet sesfscriptm i dont care then sesfscriptf it was bound to come sooner or later sesfscriptm hello hello what wrong number sesfscriptf ahh it sent shivers up my spine sesfscriptm what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us sesfscriptf behave exquisitely sesfscriptm with the most perfect poise sesfscriptf certainly i shall probably do a court curtsy sesfscriptm things that ought to matter dreadfully dont matter at all when ones happy do they sesfscriptf what is so horrible is that one cant stay happy sesfscriptm dont say that my darling sesfscriptf its true the whole business is very poor joke sesfscriptm meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love sesfscriptf yes meaning just that sesfscriptm what does it all mean thats what i asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean sesfscriptf dont laugh at me im serious sesfscriptm you mustnt be serious my darling its just what they want sesfscriptf whos they sesfscriptm all the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable sesfscriptm laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths sesfscriptm flippancy brings out the acid in their damn sweetness and light sesfscriptf if i must laugh at everything i must laugh at us too sesfscriptm certainly you must we are figures of fun alright sesfscriptf oh how long will it last this ludicrous overbearing love of ours sesfscriptm well who knows sesfscriptf we always want to bicker and fight sesfscriptm no that fire will fade long with our passion sesfscriptf oh dear shall we like that sesfscriptm it all depends on how well weve played sesfscriptf what happens if one of us dies does the one thats left still laugh sesfscriptm yes yes with all his might sesfscriptf well thats serious enough isnt it sesfscriptm no no it isnt death is very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors sesfscriptf darling i believe youre talking nonsense sesfscriptm so is everyone else in the long run lets be superficial and pity the poor philosophers sesfscriptm lets blow trumpets and squeakers and enjoy the party as much as we can like small quite idiotic little school children sesfscriptm lets savor the delight of the moment come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets sesfscriptf elliott worms dont pop sesfscriptm i dont mind what you do see you can paint yourself green all over sesfscriptm and dance naked in the place place vendome and rush away with all the men in the world and i shant say a word as long as you love me best sesfscriptf thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman ill kill you sesfscriptm do you remember that awful scene in venice sesfscriptf which particular one sesfscriptm the one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed sesfscriptf oh charles that was his name charles he did wriggle so beautifully sesfscriptm horrible thing i hated it sesfscriptf yes i know you did you threw him out of the window into the grand canal i dont think ill ever forgive you for that sesfscriptm how long did that row last sesfscriptf it went on intermittently for days sesfscriptm the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown sesfscriptf it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom sesfscriptm ah we were much younger then that was a rouser wasnt it sesfscriptf that was the first time you ever hit me sesfscriptm you didnt hit me i didnt hit you very hard sesfscriptf then the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers sesfscriptm i shall never forget his face f oh dear sesfscriptf how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous sesfscriptm we were very much younger then sesfscriptf and very much sillier sesfscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesfscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesfscriptf there was nothing in that you know that sesfscriptm i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him sesfscriptf presents a trivial little broach sesfscriptm i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste sesfscriptf not at all it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often sesfscriptm you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden sesfscriptf i did not you made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination sesfscriptm you must admit that he was in love with you wasnt he sesfscriptf just a little perhaps nothing serious sesfscriptm you let him kiss you you said you did sesfscriptf what of it sesfscriptm what of it sesfscriptf it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didnt hurt me sesfscriptm what about me sesfscriptf if you hadnt been so nosey you never would have known a thing about it sesfscriptm thats a nice point of view i must say sesfscriptf oh dear im bored with this conversation sesfscriptm so am i bored stiff want some brandy sesfscriptf no thanks sesfscriptm ill have some myself i think sesfscriptf i dont see why you want it youve already had two glasses sesfscriptm no particular reason anyway they were very small ones sesfscriptf seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing sesfscriptm you can hardly call three liquor glasses in the whole evening going on and on and on sesfscriptf its become a habit with you sesfscriptm you neednt be so grand just because you dont happen to want any at the moment sesfscriptf oh dont be so stupid sesfscriptm really amanda sesfscriptf what sesfscriptm nothing sesfscriptm going somewhere my dear sesfscriptf just making myself fascinating for you sesfscriptm ah that reply has broken my heart sesfscriptf the womans job is to allure the man watch me a minute will you sesfscriptm as a matter of fact thats perfectly true sesfscriptf oh no it isnt sesfscriptm yes it is sesfscriptf oh be quiet sesfscriptm its a pity you dont have anymore brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable sesfscriptf it doesnt seem to have worked such wonders with you sesfscriptm snap snap snap like a little adder sesfscriptf adders dont snap they sting sesfscriptm nonsense they have bags of venom behind their fangs and they snap sesfscriptf they sting sesfscriptm they snap sesfscriptf i dont care okay do you understand i dont care i dont mind if they bark and roll about like hoops sesfscriptm did you see much of peter burden after our divorce sesfscriptf yes i did quite a lot sesfscriptm i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then sesfscriptf mind your own business sesfscriptm you must have had a riotous time no restraint at all very enjoyable you never had much anyhow sesfscriptf youre quite insufferable i expect its because youre drunk sesfscriptm im not in the least drunk sesfscriptf you always had a weak head sesfscriptm i think i mentioned once before that i had three minute liquor glasses of brandy the whole evening long a child of two couldnt get drunk on that sesfscriptf on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy sesfscriptm very interesting and how about a child of six and a child of four and a child of nine sesfscriptf oh shut up sesfscriptm theyd get up a splendid little debate about that you know intemperate tots sesfscriptf not very funny dear youd better have some more brandy sesfscriptm very good idea i will sesfscriptm youd better turn that off i think sesfscriptf why sesfscriptm its very late and it will annoy the people upstairs sesfscriptf there is no one upstairs its a photographers studio sesfscriptm there are people downstairs i suppose sesfscriptf theyre away in tunis sesfscriptm this is no time of year for tunis sesfscriptf turn it on again please sesfscriptm ill do no such

knew they would your mother anyway sesmscriptm how did you know sesmscriptf from her point of view why else would i come sesmscriptm well wouldnt you want to sesmscriptm i guess you know this is why i

you sesmscriptm i didnt want to tell it to you here i wanted someplace wed never been someplace where wed be brand new to each other sesmscriptm you think this is wrong dont you this yard this chair i want you to be ready for me i dont want to win you away from anything sesmscriptf chris ive been ready a long long time sesmscriptm then hes gone forever youre sure sesmscriptf i almost got married two years ago sesmscriptm why didnt you sesmscriptf you started to write me sesmscriptm you felt something that far back sesmscriptf every day since sesmscriptm anne why didnt you let me know

sesmscriptm lets drive somewhere i want to be alone with you sesmscriptf no what is it chris your mother sesmscriptm no no nothing like that sesmscriptf then whats wrong even in your letters there was something ashamed sesmscriptm yes i suppose there has been but its going from me sesmscriptf youve got to tell me sesmscriptm i dont know where to start sesmscriptf it wouldnt work this way sesmscriptm its all mixed up with so many other things you remember overseas i was in command of a company sesmscriptf yeah sure sesmscriptm well i lost them sesmscriptf how many sesmscriptm just about all sesmscriptf oh gees sesmscriptm it takes a little time to toss that off because they werent just men sesmscriptm for instance one time itd been raining several days and this kid came to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks put them in my pocket thats only a little thing but thats the kind of guys i had sesmscriptm they didnt die they killed themselves for each other i mean that exactly a little more selfish and theyd have been here today sesmscriptm and i got this idea watching them go down everything was being destroyed see but to me it seemed there was one new thing that was made sesmscriptm a kind of responsibility man for man you understand me and then i went home and it was incredible sesmscriptm there was no meaning in it here the whole thing to them was some sort of bus accident then i went to work for dad and that whole rat race again i felt what you said ashamed somehow sesmscriptm because nobody was changed it seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys i felt wrong to be alive sesmscriptm to open that bank book to drive the new car to see the new refrigerator i mean you can take these things out of a war but when you drive the new car you have to know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man sesmscriptm you have to be a little better because of that otherwise we have is really loot and theres blood on it i dont want to take any of it i guess that included you sesmscriptf and do you still feel that way sesmscriptm i want you now annie sesmscriptf because you mustnt feel that way anymore chris because you have a right to everything you have everything chris to me too sesmscriptf and your money theres nothing wrong in your money your father put hundreds of planes in the air you should be proud a man should be paid for that sesmscriptm annie annie im going to make you a fortune sesmscriptf whatll i do with a fortune sesmscriptm what time is it theyre supposed to run around midnight this is great isnt it look at this night weve got here couldnt be better sesmscriptm actually i wanted to go a little farther up the coast get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid wed miss it how you doing sesmscriptf fine sesmscriptm is that is that is that just foam i cant even tell although if you cant tell its probably isnt them itll probably be unmistakable dont you think sesmscriptm how you doing oh no you know what i did i forgot to bring my flashlight how could i be so stupid i should have brought my flashlight sesmscriptf what flashlight sesmscriptm the flashlight the silver one theres only one isnt there sesmscriptf its not yours sesmscriptm whose is it sesmscriptf its ours its mine too sesmscriptm well sure sesmscriptf you kept saying my flashlight as if its somehow just yours how is that supposed to make me feel sesmscriptm no of course our flashlight yours and mine me flashlight es su flashlight naturally how could we not think to bring it i hope the moon stays out sesmscriptm i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cant remember if it was full last year remember sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm are you cold do you want my jacket we should have brought the blanket our blanket sesmscriptm oh man this is great i didnt even think to bring a six pack six pack would be just the ticket right about now i cant believe i forgot im like a kid its amazing i got out of the house with my fly zipped oh sesmscriptm i wonder if they can hear me talk or feel the vibrations in the sand when we move around sesmscriptf im cold sesmscriptm you want my jacket sesmscriptf its after eleven lets go home sesmscriptm are you kidding wed miss it we just got here whats the point of coming down here if we just turn around and go home sesmscriptf there is no point in coming down here sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf thats my point sesmscriptm thats my point too sesmscriptf so lets go home sesmscriptm no no no thats not my point my point is is that theres no point in coming down here if we just leave dont you want to see it sesmscriptf not particularly sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf i just dont its stupid sesmscriptm honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean this only happens once a year its a great opportunity think about the people in kansas theyd have to get plane tickets and hotel reservations to come see this were just forty minutes away its too good to pass up sesmscriptf pass up what these little fish swim onto the beach flop around and then they swim away and then they die sesmscriptm yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives i mean all that flopping around is laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating something like that sesmscriptm theres mystery here and magic m uh did i fuck up sesmscriptf what are you so excited about f big night sesmscriptm oh its a big night for these guys uh lifes last orgy sesmscriptf this isnt a moon landing were talking about its fish its fish nobody even eats sesmscriptm yeah they do okay but its fish who do something none of the other fish do like the swallows are returning to capistrano or the lemmings throwing themselves off the cliffs like that f oh augie sesmscriptm theres mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable i dont see how you can not be interested sesmscriptf im just not sesmscriptm for real sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm i dont get it first time we came here to see it you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited to get here you stubbed your toe rushing me out the door and didnt even notice until we were in the car sesmscriptf last year you will also remember our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we got into a big fight over nothing you got a sore throat and we did not see the grunions sesmscriptm we werent in a good spot sesmscriptf we didnt see them the first time either sesmscriptm we just werent in a good spot this is a much better spot ive got good instincts for these things look there whats that is that sesmscriptm no its just seaweed isnt it oh man this is great i wouldnt miss this for anything i mean think about this i know youre not interested but just think about this for a minute sesmscriptm out there someplace is this huge mass of silver fish heading this way they dont know why we dont know why it wasnt a decision they didnt take a vote no one sent them an invitation or a map sesmscriptm just some little instinctual time release firecracker went off in their little bodies and all as one they turned and formed a line as long as the california coast and started swimming sesmscriptm theyre swimming right now as if thats the only thing that matters its single mindedness with no mind urgency thats pure urge sesmscriptm they dont know what drives them they dont give it a name or ask a question they just turn as one and start the swim that brings them here to this place where we stand for a massive celebration of sex and death oh man im giving myself goose bumps all my hairs are popping up sesmscriptf thats the wind sesmscriptm well so what did you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptf look at this goose bumps sesmscriptm well so whatd you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm what i said sesmscriptf its ridiculous sesmscriptm certainly is not its slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesmscriptf its pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to take place on the beach sesmscriptm im not the only one look at these people sesmscriptf sure theyre all told the same story its what keeps us coming back for more keeps us excited keeps us thinking that life is going to start any minute now if we could just find the right spot get in on the action sesmscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesmscriptf well im sorry but its still just fish to me sesmscriptm carla can i ask you something dont take this the wrong way but are you having your period sesmscriptf goddamn it augie dont ask me that i hate it when you ask me that you always ask me that its insulting sesmscriptm well whats bugging you sesmscriptf we just have different ideas about what this evening is supposed to look like sesmscriptm theres nothing to it we come down here the grunions arrive they do their little fish business we go ooh ah look at the fish they go home we go home sesmscriptf for heavens sake we are not going to see the grunions sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf we never do do we have we ever sesmscriptm weve missed them twice sesmscriptm thats not ever sesmscriptf twice is every time weve tried thats ever sesmscriptm well see them this year sesmscriptf no we wont its pointless its like waiting up to see santa claus i feel as though my entire life is going to be spent standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasped expectantly waiting for the fish to show up and the fish wont show up sesmscriptm i thought you wanted to see them sesmscriptf you dont have any idea what im saying sesmscriptm no of course not sesmscriptf i did want to see it i always do i keep thinking this time will be the time but it never is sesmscriptm its just fish nothing to get traumatized over sesmscriptf for heavens sake this is not about fish sesmscriptm ive been trying to work this backwards but i cant seem to pinpoint the moment when we took a turn for the worse sesmscriptm you were fine during the phone call from marge dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem lets see i took a shower uh you watched the news you said the grunions are running tonight i said great lets go i feel lucky tonight sesmscriptm uhokay so im putting on my jacket putting out the animals sesmscriptf do you remember the first time we came to see it sesmscriptm uh taking the car out of the gara out of the garage sesmscriptm uh sesmscriptf it was about four years ago right after we got married we thought i was pregnant and we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses you asked me to dance so we took off our shoes and you popped the cork sesmscriptf and while we were dancing you said the softest most intimate things to me right into my ear so that i could feel them as much as hear them and i remember thinking this is it at last at last im as happy as im supposed to be sesmscriptm wait a minute ive got it sesmscriptf dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle sesmscriptm it was in the car right driving past the knickerbocker liquor locker you said lets get some champagne and i said times a wasting or something like that right thats it right you want this to be like the other time thats it of course sesmscriptf id rather not remember some things id rather not hope for some things sesmscriptm sure okay alright ive got it listen do you want to dance sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm you want to get some champagne sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm what you want me to breathe in your ear sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm you want to get married again sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm what you want a divorce sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm a vacation sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm a new carpet a poodle an ice cream a back rub a suicide pact what what carla what the hell do you want sesmscriptf i want something to turn out the way its supposed to sesmscriptm well welcome to the human race you think this is what i had in mind you think that when i proposed i had this great fantasy going that four years down the line wed come to the beach and yell at each other over fish no sesmscriptm no im just like you i thought it was going to be all peaches and roses and wind in our hair and sand in our toes and the fish will always come and the bills will always pay themselves sesmscriptm and well have three fat rosy kids and ha ha ha baby the jokes on us cause you know what you get carla you know what you get this sesmscriptf this what what is this this isnt even anything sesmscriptm yes it is sesmscriptf oh right sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf but this isnt anything like i thought anything would be like sesmscriptm no i know me neither sesmscriptf this is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything but its just not you know something else do you have any idea what im trying to say sesmscriptm im doing the best i can sesmscriptf i know you are augie really i do i know you meant for this to be special and nice and its the full moon and the sand and everything but i just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else sesmscriptm maybe if you were with somebody else too huh sesmscriptf i didnt say that sesmscriptm no i know but still i know i dont make you happy sesmscriptf for heavens sake whatever im doing id rather be doing it with you sesmscriptm yeah sesmscriptf well dont be ridiculous dont you know that youre the one who probably wishes you were with somebody else somebody who knew how to enjoy herself and didnt take everything so hard sesmscriptm actually now that you mention it no i dont sesmscriptf okay fine so were in the wrong spot but were with the right person sesmscriptm i dont know it seemed like a good spot to me i mean look at the view youve got of the moon from here sesmscriptf yeah i noticed that looks pretty on the water doesnt it big ol white moon im sorry augie sesmscriptm shh if were very quiet the fish might come sesmscriptf or not sesmscriptm or not sesmscriptm good god sesmscriptf do you think its them sesmscriptm i wonder sesmscriptf nobody knows were here except freda and she wouldnt ring up sesmscriptm it must be them then sesmscriptf what are we to do sesmscriptm well be alright darling whatever happens arent we sesmscriptf now and always sweet sesmscriptm i dont care then sesmscriptf it was bound to come sooner or later sesmscriptm hello hello what wrong number sesmscriptf oh it sent shivers up my spine sesmscriptm what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us sesmscriptf behave exquisitely sesmscriptm with the mo with the most perfect poise sesmscriptf certainly i shall probably do a court curtsey sesmscriptm ah things that ought to matter dreadfully dont matter when ones happy do they sesmscriptf but whats so horrible is that one cant stay happy sesmscriptm dont say that darling sesmscriptf its true the whole business is a very poor joke sesmscriptm meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love sesmscriptf yes meaning just that sesmscriptm what does it all mean thats what i ask myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean sesmscriptf dont laugh at me im serious sesmscriptm you mustnt be serious my dear thats just what they want sesmscriptf whos they sesmscriptm all the futile moralists who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths flippancy brings out the acid acid in their damn sweetness and light sesmscriptf if i laugh at everything i must laugh at us too sesmscriptm certainly you must were figures of fun alright sesmscriptf how long will it last this ludicrous and overbearing love of ours sesmscriptm who knows sesmscriptf shall we always want to bicker and fight sesmscriptm no that fire will fade along with our passion sesmscriptf oh dear should we like that sesmscriptm it all depends on how well weve played sesmscriptf what happens if one of us dies does the one thats left still laugh sesmscriptm yes yes with all his might sesmscriptf well thats serious enough isnt it sesmscriptm no no it isnt deaths very laughable such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors sesmscriptf darling i believe youre talking nonsense sesmscriptm so is everyone else in the long run lets be superficial and pity the poor philosophers lets blow trumpets and squeakers and and enjoy the party as much as we can like very small quite idiotic little school children sesmscriptm lets savor the delight of the moment come and kiss me darling before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets sesmscriptf elliot worms dont pop sesmscriptm i dont mind what you do see you can paint yourself bright green all over and dance naked in the place vendome and rush off madly with all the men in the world and i shant say a word as long as you love me best sesmscriptf thank you dear the same applies to you except that if i catch you so much as looking at another woman i will kill you sesmscriptm do you remember that awful scene we had in venice sesmscriptf which particular one sesmscriptm the one when you bought that little painted wooded snake and put it on my bed sesmscriptf oh charles that was his name charles oh he did wriggle so beautifully sesmscriptm horrible thing i hated it sesmscriptf i know you did you threw it out of the window into the grand canal i dont think ill ever forgive you for that sesmscriptm how long did that row last sesmscriptf it went on intermittently for days sesmscriptm the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt holes in my dressing gown sesmscriptf it burnt my comb too and all the towels in the bathroom sesmscriptm line sesmscriptm how that was a rouser wasnt it sesmscriptf that was the first time you ever hit me sesmscriptm i didnt hit you very hard sesmscriptf the manager came in and found is rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers oh dear sesmscriptm ah i shall never forget his face sesmscriptf how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous sesmscriptm yes we were very much younger then sesmscriptf and very much sillier sesmscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesmscriptm that was a rouser wasnt it sesmscriptf that was the first time you ever hit me sesmscriptm i didnt hit you very hard sesmscriptf the manager came in and found us rolling about on the floor biting and scratching like panthers oh dear sesmscriptm i shall never forget his face sesmscriptf how ridiculous how utterly utterly ridiculous sesmscriptm we were very much younger then sesmscriptf and very much sillier sesmscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesmscriptf you knew there was nothing in that sesmscriptm i knew nothing of the sort you took presents from him sesmscriptf presents a trivial little brooch sesmscriptm i remember it well bristling with diamonds in the worst possible taste sesmscriptf not at all it was very pretty i still have it and i wear it often sesmscriptm you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden sesmscriptf i did not you made the whole thing up in your jealous imagination sesmscriptm you must admit that he was in love with you wasnt he sesmscriptf just a little perhaps nothing serious sesmscriptm line sesmscriptf let him kiss you sesmscriptm you let him kiss you you said you did sesmscriptf what of it sesmscriptm what of it sesmscriptf it gave him a lot of pleasure and it didnt hurt me sesmscriptm what about me sesmscriptf if you hadnt been so nosey you never would have known a thing about it sesmscriptm thats a nice point of view i must say sesmscriptf oh dear im bored with this conversation sesmscriptm so am i bored stiff sesmscriptm you want some brandy sesmscriptf no thanks sesmscriptm ill have a little myself i think sesmscriptf i dont see why you want it youve already had two glasses sesmscriptm no particular reason anyhow they were very small ones sesmscriptf it seems so silly to go on and on and on with such a thing sesmscriptm you can hardly call three liquor glasses in a whole evening going on and on and on sesmscriptf its become a habit with you sesmscriptm you neednt be so grand just because you dont happen to want any at the moment sesmscriptf oh dont be so stupid sesmscriptm really amanda sesmscriptf what sesmscriptm nothing sesmscriptm going out somewhere my dear sesmscriptf no just making myself fascinating for you sesmscriptm oh that reply has broken my heart sesmscriptf the womans job is to allure the man watch me a minute will you sesmscriptm as a matter of fact thats perfectly true sesmscriptf oh no it isnt sesmscriptm yes it is sesmscriptf oh be quiet sesmscriptm line sesmscriptf its a pity you didnt its a pity you didnt have more brandy m its a pity what sesmscriptm its a pity you didnt have any more brandy it might have made you a little less disagreeable sesmscriptf it doesnt seem to have worked such wonders with you sesmscriptm line f snap sesmscriptm snap oh snap snap snap like a little adder sesmscriptf adders dont snap they sting sesmscriptm they nonsense they have a little bag of venom behind their fangs and they snap sesmscriptf they sting sesmscriptm they snap sesmscriptf i dont care do you understand i dont care i dont mind if they bark and roll about like hoops sesmscriptm did you see much of peter burden after our divorce sesmscriptf yes i did quite a lot sesmscriptm i suppose you let him kiss you a good deal more then hmm sesmscriptf mind your own business sesmscriptm you must have had a riotous time sesmscriptm no restraint at all very enjoyable you never had much anyhow sesmscriptf youre quite insufferable i expected its because youre drunk sesmscriptm im not in the least drunk sesmscriptf you always had a weak head sesmscriptm i think i mentioned once before that ive only had three minute liquor glasses of brandy this whole evening thats hardly enough to get a child of two drunk sesmscriptf on the contrary a child of two could get violently drunk on only one glass of brandy sesmscriptm very interesting and how about a child of four and a child of six and a child of nine sesmscriptf oh shut up sesmscriptm we might get up a splendid little a splendid little debate about this you know intemperate tots sesmscriptf not very funny dear youd better have some more brandy sesmscriptm very good idea i will sesmscriptm you better turn that off i think sesmscriptf why sesmscriptm its late and the people upstairs will get annoyed sesmscriptf there arent any people upstairs its a photographers studio sesmscriptm there are people downstairs i suppose sesmscriptf theyre away in tunis sesmscriptm this is no time of year for tunis sesmscriptf turn it on again please

africa you flew threw heath row to here sesfimprof right sesfimprof yeah sesfimprom okay well let me see here i sesfimprom it seems like it went through heath row i see it here uh sesfimprof thats good sesfimprom but uh i dont see it here in the airport yet uh sesfimprom im not sure where it is we can absolutely keep an eye out for for it for you sesfimprof well i cant leave without it i mean could you find out sesfimprom well im not a miracle worker i dont know what i can do for you i dont have the bag right here sesfimprof right well can you get on the computer maybe and like track it down and see when its going to get here sesfimprom well as i told you it left heath row and it seems to have arrived here but if you cant find it thenare you sure you know what your bag looks like sesfimprof yes sir i know what my bag looks like sesfimprom okay and what is that what kind of bag is it sesfimprof um its a travel backpack its green and gray its got my name on it and my information sesfimprom and you couldnt find it sesfimprof no it didnt turn up at the baggage claim sesfimprom are you sure sesfimprof i mean weve gone through all of this ive been to five people already who sesfimprom well obviously that wasnt me so im going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point sesfimprof okay sesfimprom all right now um its green travel bag you couldnt find it and was there something important in it that you need it sesfimprof yes lots of really like sentimental value only but sesfimprom sentimental value sesfimprof really important stuff sesfimprom right well i dont know what to tell you um what i can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight sesfimprof thats not going to cut it like really i really need to get this bag back sesfimprom no i understand i mean its got to be tough all those sentimental things but um this is all i can do for you sesfimprof does this happen often do theyyou just lose baggage and you just offer people money for it sesfimprom well you know sometimes thatsreally i mean what else could we do sesfimprof uh not lose the baggage in the first place i mean youre offering a service here i paid so much money for that ticket sesfimprom well sesfimprom obviously maam sesfimprom i am sorry maam sesfimprom lets lets just relax for a moment maam you understand obviously were going to do everything we can to keep all of your luggage here sesfimprom obviously were not trying to lose your luggage do you really believe that were trying to lose your luggage maam sesfimprof no but i mean like why cant why cant you find it where did it go who lost it sesfimprom well if i knew that then id know where it was wouldnt i sesfimprof well i justi paid so much money for this ticket i feel like you guys should be able to getto offer me more than a fifty dollar voucher sesfimprom well were talking about one bag you personally made it here didnt you sesfimprof yeah meaning i didnt die in a fiery plane crash how convenient but um i paid two thousand dollar to ride your airline and i would really appreciate getting my bags there to my destination in one place sesfimprom thats what the cost of the ticket was for sesfimprom maam international flights are not cheap and theres many reasons for that it does not have solely to do with your baggage or sesfimprof right but part of the agreement is that im paying so that i can take myself and my belongings with me sesfimprom right yes maam sesfimprof and that youre going to transport them safely from one place to another sesfimprom right and also if youll read the fine print of your agreement youll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage it is a fifty dollar voucher sesfimprof thats all you can offer me i mean my the stuff in there is worth way more than fifty dollar sesfimprom well i understand that did you buy flight insurance sesfimprof no sesfimprom well my hands are really tied then sesfimprof why do i need flight insurance why dont you guys just guarantee that youre going to get the stuff that i leave with to my destination sesfimprom well its like any kind of insurance you dontwhen you get it then you get more you know like if you sesfimprof right but if im riding a bus i dont need to buy luggage insurance that the backpack i take on is going to get to my destination with me sesfimprom well of course not because youve got your backpack with you the whole time now if youyou said this was a travel bag why werent you carrying it on if it was so important sesfimprof because they made me check it its too heavy sesfimprom uh so it was really heavy sesfimprof so i would have carried it on but they made me check it and then they lost it sesfimprom well you know what it could still turn up but until then i can offer you this fifty dollar voucher sesfimprof theres nothing else you can do sesfimprom im sorry maam theres nothing else i can do my hands are really tied here i really wish there was something else i could do for you sesfimprof i dont believe that for a second sesfimprom well i dont know why you wouldnt believe that sesfimprom obviously im doing everything that i can here sesfimprof no i dont think you are i mean if you were doing everything you could youd either give me more money or youd figure out where my bag is sesfimprom well i have no way to give you more money im giving you as much money as i can and figuring as far as figuring out where you bag is sesfimprof what do you mean as you can who makes up these rules sesfimprom makes up sesfimprof youre an autono autonomous human being you could you could go into the com sesfimprom the airline makes these rules mom maam sesfimprof you could go into the computer and you know print sesfimprom ive gone into the computer i told you exactly what i can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here sesfimprof so im just supposed to oh well oops my luggage is gone and be fine with that and take your stinking fifty dollar voucher sesfimprom well you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up and if it does then well deliver it to you sesfimprof and you have no guarantee sesfimprom i have no guarantee absolutely not sesfimprof this is ridiculous sesfimprom how can i guarantee finding your luggage when its lost sesfimprof uh because you guys lost it so it should be your responsibility to find it too sesfimprom right well when youre at home and you lose something do you guarantee that youre going to find it later on sesfimprof oh come on would you cut it out this is ridiculous sesfimprom well it sounds to me like youre being ridiculous sesfimprof no i dont think i am i like have a whole bunch of stuff that means a lot to me and i brought it you know from africa its not like i can just go back and get it whenever i want sesfimprom right sesfimprof its not like i can go to kmart and buy another sesfimprom i understand that maam but things get lost theres nothing i can do about that things happen accidents happen sesfimprom and while i really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now obviously i cant do that sesfimprof okay fine sesfimprom so youd like the fifty dollar voucher sesfimprof yeah ill take your fifty dollar voucher sesfimprom okay just fill out these three forms and um youll well have that sent to you within the next three weeks and of course well definitely keep an eye out for your bag sesfimprof thanks sesfimprom you have a wonderful day sesfimprom whats

saw that and you youve been sesfscriptm what sesfscriptf well sort of embarrassed soon as i came sesfscriptm well the plan was to kind of sneak up on you over a period of a week or so but uh they take it for granted that were all set sesfscriptf i figured they would your mother at least sesfscriptm how did you know sesfscriptf well from her point of view why else would i come sesfscriptm well would you want to i guess you know this is why i asked you to come sesfscriptf i guess this is why i came sesfscriptm anne i love you i love you a great deal i love you sesfscriptm i i i have no imagination

foreveryoure sure sesfscriptf i almost got married two years ago sesfscriptm why didnt you sesfscriptf you started to write me sesfscriptm you felt something that far back sesfscriptf every day since sesfscriptm annie why didnt you say something to me sesfscriptf well i was waiting for you i mean i didntuntil then you hadnt written and when you write when you wrote what did you say i mean you sure can be ambiguous chris sesfscriptm give me a kiss ann give me a sesfscriptm oh god i kissed annie i cant believe i kissed annie how long ive wanted to do this sesfscriptf ill never forgive you why did you wait so long all this time ive been wondering if i was a fool for thinking of you sesfscriptm oh annie were going to live now im going to make you so happy sesfscriptf not like that youre not sesfscriptm i kissed you sesfscriptf like larrys brother do it like you chris chris whats the matter sesfscriptm lets lets drive someplace i i want to be alone with you sesfscriptf no what is it your mother sesfscriptm no nothing like that sesfscriptf what is it even in your letters there is something ashamed sesfscriptm yeah i suppose i have been but its going from me sesfscriptm i dont know how to start sesfscriptf it wouldnt work like this sesfscriptm its its mixed up with so many other things i sesfscriptm remember when i was overseas i was in command of the company sesfscriptf yeah sure sesfscriptm yeah i lost them sesfscriptf how many sesfscriptm just about all sesfscriptf oh gee sesfscriptm takes a little time to toss something like that off you know because they werent just men sesfscriptm for instance theres this one time it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and gave me his last pair of dry socks you know he just put them in my pocket sesfscriptm i know that thats not a big thing but its just the kind of guys i had they didnt die they they killed themselves for each other sesfscriptm i mean that exactly thata little more selfish and they would have still been here today sesfscriptm and i got an ideal watching them all go down everything was being destroyed see and sesfscriptm but it seemed to me that something new was being created at the same time a kind of responsibility man for man do you understand me sesfscriptm and to show thattoto bring that back onto the earth again like a like a monument and everyone would have it standing behind them and and it would make a difference for them sesfscriptm and then i went home and it was incredible it had no meaning here sesfscriptm it was all like some kind of bus accident to them i went back to work with my dad in that whole rat race again sesfscriptm and i felt what you said ashamed somehowbecause nobody had changed at all it seemed to make suckers out of a whole lot of guys and sesfscriptm it felt wrong to be aliveto open that bankbook to buy that new car to look at that new refrigerator i mean you can take those things out of the war but if you drive that car you have to know that that comes from the love that a man has for a man and youve got to be a little bit better than that sesfscriptm and if youre not then its all just loot and its got blood on it and i dont want any of it and i guess that included you sesfscriptf do you still feel like that sesfscriptm i i want you now annie sesfscriptf because you cant feel like that anymore chris you hear me i mean everything that you have you deserve and that includes me and your father your father put hundreds of planes in the air you should be proud a man should be paid for that sesfscriptm oh annie annie i am going to make you a fortune sesfscriptf what would i do with a fortune sesfscriptm what time is it isnt it supposed to start running around midnight this is great isnt it look at this great night we got here couldnt be better sesfscriptm actually i was hoping to go a little bit further up the coast to get away from the lights and the people but i was afraid i will miss it how are you doing sesfscriptf fine sesfscriptm is thatno no no is that foam i cant even tell although if i if i cant tell it probably isnt it right itll probably be unmistakable but dont you think how you doing sesfscriptm oh no you know what i did i forgot my flashlight how could i be so stupid i cant believe i forgot my flashlight sesfscriptf what flashlight sesfscriptm the flashlight the silver one theres only one isnt there sesfscriptf its not your flashlight sesfscriptm whose is it sesfscriptf its ours our flashlight its yours and mine sesfscriptm well sure sesfscriptf i mean you keep saying my flashlight as if its somehow just yours hows that suppose to make me feel sesfscriptm no of course you are right our flashlight me flashlight is you flashlight naturally how can we not think to bring it sesfscriptm well i hope the moon stays out well i wonder do they always wander during a full moon i cant remember wasnt it full last year do you remember sesfscriptf yes sesfscriptm are you cold you want my jacket we should have bought a blanket our blanket this is great isnt it sesfscriptm i didnt even think to bring a sixpack a sixpack would be just the thing right about now i cant believe i forgot and look at kid i am surprise i make it out of the house about flies it sesfscriptm laughter i wonder if they can hear me talk or if they can feel the vibration in the sand when we are moving around sesfscriptf i am cold sesfscriptm you want my jacket sesfscriptf its after eleven lets go home sesfscriptm are you kidding wed miss it we just got here whats the point of coming out here if we are just going to leave sesfscriptf there is no point in coming out here sesfscriptm right sesfscriptf thats my point sesfscriptm thats my point too sesfscriptf so lets go sesfscriptm no no no thats not my point my point is whats the point in coming down here if we are just going to turn around and go home dont you want to see it sesfscriptf not particularly sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf i just dont sesfscriptm honey this is a natural phenomenon i mean it happens like once a year its a great opportunity sesfscriptm think about people in kansas they have to get a a plane reservation and a hotel reservation just to see this uh but we are just forty minutes away too good to pass up sesfscriptf pass up what its little fish one month on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die sesfscriptm yeah but that moment on the beach is the highlight of their little lives all that flopping around is laying eggs or what you mating or spawning or something like that sesfscriptm this is a big night for these guys lifes last orgy yeah sesfscriptf what are you so excited about i mean its notits not rocket science we are talking about its fish its fish nobody even eats sesfscriptm yeah they do sesfscriptfxx augie sesfscriptm okay but they are fish that do something that no other fish do like the swallows returning to capistrano or the lemmings jumping off a cliff you know like that sesfscriptm theres theres mystery here and magic a little bit of the unexplainable i cant understand how you could not be interested sesfscriptf i am just not sesfscriptm for real sesfscriptf yes sesfscriptm i dont get it the first time we came out here you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited that you stuff your toe pushing me out of the door and you didnt notice it until you got into the car sesfscriptf last year you also remember our shoes got wet and i got sand in my panties and we got into a big fight you had a sore throat and we did not see the grunions sesfscriptm we werent in a good spot sesfscriptf we didnt see them the first time either sesfscriptm we just werent in a good spot this is a much better spot i got a great instinct for these things sesfscriptm look there whats that is it is that aah its a seaweed isnt it sesfscriptm oh this is great i wouldnt miss this for the world i mean think about this i know you are not interested but think about this for a second sesfscriptm somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction they dont know why and we dont know why they didnt get an invitation and it wasnt a vote it wasnt a decision and nobody sent them a map or anything like that sesfscriptm its just some little instinctual timerelease firecracker that went off inside them and all this one they turn around and form a line as long as the california coast and just started swimming sesfscriptm they are swimming right now as if its the only thing that matters its its single mindedness with no mind urgency thats pure urge its they dont know what drives them they they dont give any name or ask any question they just turn as one and started to swim to the very point we are standing right now for a massive celebration of sex and death god its giving me goose bumps all over my hairs on my arm popping up sesfscriptf thats the wind sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptm well so what do you think sesfscriptf about what sesfscriptm what i was just saying sesfscriptf its ridiculous sesfscriptm it certainly is not its slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesfscriptf its pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this wonderful event is going to occur on the beach sesfscriptm i am not the only one look at all these people sesfscriptf yeah they are all told the same thing they are all told that you know gets them excited and they cant wait and that if they just get in on the right spot than you than maybe life will start sesfscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesfscriptf i am sorry its just fish to me sesfscriptm carla can i ask you a question now dont be upset are you having a period sesfscriptf god damn it augie why do you always ask things like that its so insulting sesfscriptm whats bugging you sesfscriptf i just had a different idea of what this evening is going to look like sesfscriptm theres nothing to it we come down here the grunion arrives and they do their little fish thing and we say oh wow look at the little fish they go home we go home sesfscriptf for heavens sake augie grow up we are not going to see the grunions sesfscriptm why not sesfscriptf we never do have we ever we never have sesfscriptm we miss them twice its not ever sesfscriptf twice is every time we tried thats ever sesfscriptm well we will see them this year sesfscriptf no we wont augie its like waiting for santa claus to come i feel like i am going to spend my entire life standing on the beach with my eyes wide open and my hands clasp expectantly in front of me waiting for the fish to show up and the fish will not show up sesfscriptm i thought you wanted to see it sesfscriptf i did i do want to see it i always want to see it augie sesfscriptm its just fish its nothing to get traumatize over sesfscriptf for heavens sake this is not about fish sesfscriptm okay i been trying to work this backwards but i cant seem to pinpoint a moment when we took a turn for the worst here sesfscriptm when you are on the phone with marge everything was fine dinner was okay doing the dishes was no problem lets see i took a shower and you were watching the news and you said the grunions are running tonight and i said great lets go i am feeling lucky sesfscriptm right so i am putting on my jacket and putting up the animals and pulling the car out of the garage sesfscriptf augie do you remember the first time we came to see it it was about four years ago right after we got married and we thought i was pregnant sesfscriptf we had a bottle of champagne but no glasses and you ask me to dance so we took off our shoes and while we were dancing you said the most intimate things right in my ears so i could feel them as much as hear them sesfscriptf and i remember thinking finally finally i am as happy as i am supposed to be sesfscriptm wait a minute i got it sesfscriptf dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne from the bottle sesfscriptm it was in the car right when we were passing knickerbocker liquor locker you said lets get some champagne and i said time wasting or something like that right of course sesfscriptf i rather not remember some things i rather not hope for some things sesfscriptm okay all right i got it you wanted it to be like the other time okay no problem listen you want to dance sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm you want me to go get some champagne sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm take off our shoes sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm what you want me to whisper in your ear sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm you want to get married again sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm what what you want a divorce sesfscriptf no no sesfscriptm a vacation a new carpet a poodle a bag of ice cream a suicide pack what what carla what the hell do you want sesfscriptfxx no sesfscriptf i want something to turn out the way it is suppose to turn out sesfscriptm what welcome to the human race sesfscriptm you think this is what i had in mind you think that when i propose i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we will end up on a beach arguing over fish you think that i knew that there would be times when you will look at me like i am used kleenex or that i will look at you and think holy hell whats the next flight to alaska sesfscriptm no no i was just like you i thought it will be all peaches and roses and and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish will always come and the bills will always magically pay themselves and we will have three fat rosy kids and we will be haha baby the joke is on us sesfscriptm because you know what carla you know what you get this sesfscriptf this what what is this this isnt even anything sesfscriptm yes it is sesfscriptf sure this is standing this is waiting this is fighting sesfscriptm right sesfscriptf but this isnt anything like i thought it would be sesfscriptm no i know me either sesfscriptf i mean it is just this i mean it includes a lot and everything and you know its the sand and its the full moon and i justi am sorry but i couldnt help wishing i was somewhere else sesfscriptm maybe if you are with somebody else too sesfscriptf i didnt say that sesfscriptm no i know but i know i dont make you happy sesfscriptf for heavens sake augie wherever i am i always wanted to be with you sesfscriptm yeah sesfscriptf for heavens sake dont you know that sesfscriptf whatever i am doing i wanted to be with you i mean you are probably the one who wishes you were with somebody else somebody who didnt take everything so hard and who knows how to enjoy herself sesfscriptm actually now that you mention it no i dont sesfscriptf good so maybe we are on the wrong spot but we are with the right person sesfscriptm i dont know seems like a pretty good spot to me i mean look at the view of the moon you got from here sesfscriptf yes i did notice that it does look really beautiful on the water the gold white moon sesfscriptm well look what we have got here sesfscriptf augie you bought refreshments sesfscriptm well its not champagne sesfscriptf well than we dont need glasses sesfscriptm are you still cold you still want to go home sesfscriptf no i am beginning to think that maybe this is the spot after all sesfscriptm shh if were very quiet the fish might come sesfscriptf or not sesfscriptm or not sesfscriptm good god sesfscriptf you think its them sesfscriptm i wonder sesfscriptf freda is the only one who knows were up here and she wouldnt call up sesfscriptm it must be them then sesfscriptf what will be do sesfscriptm were all right darling arent we whatever happens sesfscriptf now and always my sweet sesfscriptm i dont care then sesfscriptf it was bound to happen sooner or later sesfscriptm hello hello what wrong number sesfscriptf oh it sent shivers up my spine sesfscriptm oh what shall we do if they suddenly walk in on us sesfscriptf behave exquisitely sesfscriptm with the most perfect poise sesfscriptf yes i shall probably do a court curtsey sesfscriptm laughter oh the things that ought to matter most dreadfully dont seem to matter at all when ones happy do they sesfscriptf um its a pity that one cant stay this way forever sesfscriptm darling dont say that sesfscriptf well its true sesfscriptf the whole business is really rather ridiculous sesfscriptm meaning that sacred and beautiful thing love sesfscriptf meaning exactly that sesfscriptm what does it all mean thats what i asked myself in my ceaseless quest for ultimate truth dear god what does it all mean sesfscriptf dont laugh at me im serious sesfscriptm you mustnt be serious my dear one thats just what they want sesfscriptf whos they sesfscriptm all the futile mortals who try to make life unbearable laugh at them be flippant laugh at everything all their sacred shibboleths flippancy brings out the acid in their damned sweetness and light sesfscriptf well if i laugh at everything i must laugh at us too sesfscriptm certainly you must were figures of fun alright laughter sesfscriptf well what ifwhat happens when our love sesfscriptf how long will it last this overbearing love of ours sesfscriptm who knows sesfscriptf well shall we always want to bicker and fight sesfscriptm no that fire will fade along with our passion sesfscriptf oh dear shall we like that sesfscriptm it all depends on how well we played sesfscriptf well what if one of us dies does the other laugh then sesfscriptm yes yes with all his might sesfscriptf well thats rather serious isnt it sesfscriptm no no it isnt death is very laughable come such a cunning little mystery all done with mirrors sesfscriptf my dear i do believe youre talking nonsense sesfscriptm no so is everyone else in the long run lets be superficial and pity the poor philosophers lets blow trumpets and squeakers and sesfscriptm enjoy the party as long as we can like very little quite idiotic schoolchildren garbage lets savor the delight of the moment sesfscriptm darling come here and kiss me before your body rots and worms pop in and out of your eye sockets sesfscriptf elliot worms dont pop sesfscriptm i dont mind what you do see you could paint your body green all over and dance naked through the place vendome and run off with every man in the world and i shant say a word as long as i know that you love me best sesfscriptf oh thank you dear and the same goes for you except that if i so much as see you looking at another woman ill kill you sesfscriptm do you remember that awful scene we had in venice sesfscriptf which particular one sesfscriptm the one where you bought that little painted wooden snake and put it on my bed sesfscriptf charles that was his name he did wriggle so beautifully sesfscriptm horrible thing i hate it sesfscriptf i know you threw him out the window into the canal i dont think ill ever forgive you for that sesfscriptm how long did that row last sesfscriptf it went on intermittently for days sesfscriptm the worst one was in cannes when your curling irons burnt a hole in my new dressing gown sesfscriptf uh it burned all the towels in the bathroom too sesfscriptm oh that was quite a rouser wasnt it sesfscriptf that was the first time you ever hit me sesfscriptm oh i didnt hit you very hard sesfscriptf and then the manager came in and found us rolling around on the floor biting and scratching like panthers sesfscriptm laughter i shall never forget his face sesfscriptf oh ridiculous utterly ridiculous sesfscriptm oh we were very much younger then sesfscriptf and very much sillier sesfscriptm oh as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesfscriptf you knew there was nothing sesfscriptm as a matter of fact the real cause of that row was peter burden sesfscriptf you knew there was nothing in that sesfscriptm i knew nothing of the sort you accepted presents from him sesfscriptf only a trivial little broach sesfscriptm i remember it well covered in diamonds in the worst possible taste sesfscriptf no not at all ii still have it i wear it quite often sesfscriptm you went out of your way to torture me over peter burden sesfscriptf you worked the whole thing up in your jealous imagination sesfscriptm you must admit that he was in love with you wasnt he sesfscriptf maybe just a little but sesfscriptm you let him kiss you you said you did sesfscriptf and what of it sesfscriptm what of it sesfscriptf well i he got a lot of pleasure out of it and it didnt hurt me sesfscriptm what about me sesfscriptf well if you hadnt been so nosey and suspicious you never would have heard about it sesfscriptm well thats a nice point of view i must say sesfscriptf im growing quite tired and bored of this conversation sesfscriptm so am i bored stiff would you like some brandy sesfscriptf no sesfscriptm ill have a little i think sesfscriptf i dont see why you want any youve already had three glasses sesfscriptm no particular reason besides they were very small ones sesfscriptf well it seems silly to go on and on in such a thing sesfscriptm you can hardly call three liqueur glasses of brandy in a whole evening going on and on sesfscriptf its becoming a habit with you sesfscriptm you neednt be so grand simply because you dont happen to want any at the moment sesfscriptf dont be so stupid sesfscriptm really amanda sesfscriptm going out somewhere dear sesfscriptf just making myself fascinating for you sesfscriptm oh that reply has broken my heart sesfscriptf its the womans job to allure

saw that and well youve been sesmscriptm what sesmscriptf youve been sort of embarrassed since i got here sesmscriptm well i planned on kind of sneaking up on you in a period of a week or so but they all take it for granted that were set sesmscriptf i figured they would your mother at least sesmscriptm how did you know sesmscriptf well from her perspective i mean why else would i come here sesmscriptm well so would you want to i mean i guess you know thats why i asked you to come sesmscriptf yes thats why i came sesmscriptm annie i love you i love you a great deal i love you i

been ready for a long time sesmscriptm so hes gone forever then you sure sesmscriptf i almost got married two years ago sesmscriptm why didnt you sesmscriptf you started to write me sesmscriptm you felt something that far back sesmscriptf everyday since sesmscriptm annie why didnt you call me or tell me sesmscriptf well i mean until then you never wrote and when you did what did you say i mean you sure can be ambiguous sesmscriptm give me a kiss annie give me a sesmscriptm oh god i kissed annie i kissed annie i cant how long have i waited to do that sesmscriptf ill never forgive you why did you wait so long all this time ive sat around wondering if i was crazy for thinking of you sesmscriptm oh annie were gonna live now im going to make you so happy sesmscriptf not like that youre not sesmscriptm i kissed you sesmscriptf like larrys brother do it like you chris whats the matter sesmscriptm lets go for a ride i i i want to be alone with you sesmscriptf no chris what is it is it your mother sesmscriptm no nothing like that sesmscriptf you have to tell me sesmscriptf even in your letters there was something ashamed sesmscriptm yeah i suppose i have been but its going for me sesmscriptf you have to tell me sesmscriptm i dont i dont know where to start sesmscriptf it wouldnt work like this sesmscriptm its so mixed up with so many other things sesmscriptm you remember when i was overseas i was in command of a company sesmscriptf yeah sure sesmscriptm i lost them sesmscriptf how many sesmscriptm just about all sesmscriptm it it takes time to toss something like that offi mean because they werent just men sesmscriptm for instance there was this time and it had been raining for several days and this kid came up to me and he gave me his last pair of dry socks just put them in my pocket sesmscriptm i know its its just a little thing but thats just the kind of guys i had they didnt die they killed themselves for each other sesmscriptm i mean that exactly anymore selfish just a little bit more selfish and they would have been here today and it gave me an idea as i was watching them all go down sesmscriptm everything was being destroyed see but i felt like something new was being created at the same time like it kind of responsibility you know man to man do you understand what im saying sesmscriptm and and to see that again to to bring that back on the earth again like like a monument that that would stand behind these men and and and it would make a difference to them sesmscriptm it was and then i went home and it was incredible it didnt have any meaning there sesmscriptm i mean the whole thing was like some kind of bus accident to them sesmscriptm so i went back to work for my dad and that whole rat race again sesmscriptm i felt what you said ashamed somehow because nobody had changed at all sesmscriptm it seemed to make suckers out of so many guys and ii felt wrong to be alive to to open that bank book to to drive that car the new car and look at that new refrigerator i mean sesmscriptm you can take those things out of the war but if youre gonna drive that car youve got to know that that came from the love a man can have from a man and youve got to be a little bit better because of that because if youre not then its all just loot and theres blood on it and i didnt want any of it sesmscriptm and i guess that included you sesmscriptf do you still feel like that sesmscriptm i want you now annie sesmscriptf because you cant feel like that anymore chris because everything you have you have a right to me included sesmscriptf and you father he put hundreds of planes in the air and you should be proud a man should be paid for that sesmscriptm oh annie sesmscriptf laughter what will i do with a fortune sesmscriptm annie i am going to make you a fortune m oh garbage sesmscriptm what time is it theyre supposed to run around midnight oh this is great isnt it look at the night weve got here it couldnt be better actually i wanted to go a little further up the coast you know to get away from all the lights and the people i was afraid we might miss it though so how are you doing sesmscriptf fine sesmscriptm whats that is that wait is that foam i cant even tell oh actually i guess if i cant tell then it probably isnt it is it it will probably be unmistakable dont you think sesmscriptm this is great how are you doing oh no oh do you know what i did i forgot the flashlight how could i be so stupid i forgot the flashlight sesmscriptf what flashlight sesmscriptm the flashlight the silver one theres only one isnt there stupid sesmscriptf you mean our flashlight sesmscriptm well sesmscriptf i mean you kept saying my flashlight the flashlight like it was only somehow yours how is that supposed to make me feel sesmscriptm oh no of course our flashlight me flashlight is to you flashlight naturally sesmscriptm how could we have forgotten it well i hope the moon stays out i wonder do they always run during a full moon i cant remember was the moon full last year do you remember sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm are you cold do you want my jacket we should have brought the blanket our blanket oh this is great i didnt even think to bring a six pack oh a six pack would be just the ticket right about now sesmscriptm i cant believe i forgotim like a little kid im surprised i made it out of the house with my fly zipped oh laughter sesmscriptm oh i wonder if they can hear me or if they can feel the vibrations when we move around in the sand or something sesmscriptf im cold sesmscriptm do you want my jacket sesmscriptf its after eleven lets just go home sesmscriptm are you kidding we just got here wed miss it whats the point of coming all the way out here if were just going to turn around and go home sesmscriptf there is no point in coming out here sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf thats my point sesmscriptm thats my point too sesmscriptf so lets go sesmscriptm oh no no no no thats not my point my point is whats the point coming out here if were just going to leave dont you want to see it sesmscriptf not particularly sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf i just dont sesmscriptm oh sesmscriptf its stupid sesmscriptm honey its a natural phenomenon i mean this kind of thing only happens once a year its a great opportunity sesmscriptm i mean think about people in kansas theyve got to get like you know plane tickets and hotel reservations just to see this were just forty minutes away its just too good of an opportunity to pass up sesmscriptf pass what up its its just little fish and they swim up on the beach and they flop around and they swim away and then they die sesmscriptm yeah but all that time on the beach is the highlight of their little lives you know sesmscriptm and all that about flopping around its like laying eggs or what do you spawning or mating or something like that sesmscriptm i mean this is a big night for these guys you know lifes last orgy sesmscriptf what are you so excited about this isnt rocket science this is just fish fish nobody even eats sesmscriptm yeah they do sesmscriptf augie sesmscriptm all right but they are fish that do something no other fish do like the swallows were turning into capistrano or lemmings jumping off the cliffs you know like that theres theres magic here and mystery and a little bit of the unexplainable you know i cant see how you could not be interested sesmscriptf im just not sesmscriptm for real sesmscriptf yes sesmscriptm i dont get it i mean the first time we came you said it was the best night of your life and last year i remember distinctly you were so excited about coming that you stubbed your toe toe pushing me out the door and you didnt even notice until you got in the car sesmscriptf well if you also remember last year we our shoes got wet i got sand in my panties we had a big argument you had a sore throat and we didnt see the grunion sesmscriptm we werent in a good spot sesmscriptf we didnt see them the first time either sesmscriptm we just werent in a good spot this is a much better spot ive got a great sense for these things sesmscriptm look there what is that is that oh no thats seaweed sesmscriptm oh this is great i wouldnt miss this for the world i mean think about this i know youre not interested but just think about this for a second sesmscriptm somewhere out there is a giant mass of silver fish all swimming in this direction they dont know why theyre doing it we dont know why theyre doing it they didnt it wasnt a decision no one took a vote nobody sent them an invitation or a map or anything like that it was just some internal time release fire cracker that went off and all as one they turned around and formed this giant line as long as the california coastline and they just started swimming they are swimming right now at this very moment and and sesmscriptm and its single mindedness with no mind it its urgency its pure urge i mean they didnt make any decisions they dont ask any questions they dont give it a name sesmscriptm they just all as one turn around and start swimming to this very point where we are standing now for one last celebration of sex and death god its giving me goosebumps look at all the hairs that are standing up sesmscriptf thats the wind sesmscriptm well so what do you think sesmscriptm well so what do you think sesmscriptf about what sesmscriptm what i was just saying sesmscriptf its ridiculous sesmscriptm it certainly is not its slightly exaggerated scientific fact sesmscriptf its pr somebody sold you a bill of goods that this magical thing would be happening on the beach sesmscriptm im not the only one look at all these people sesmscriptf sure everybody is told the same thing it keeps us all excited it keeps us all coming back for more it keeps us thinking that life is gonna start now any minute if we can just find the right spot and get in on the action sesmscriptm are we talking about the same thing sesmscriptf im sorry its just its its just fish to me sesmscriptm uh carla can i ask you a question no dont get upset but are you having your period sesmscriptf god damn it augie seriously you always ask me that why do you ask me that i hate it its so insulting sesmscriptm whats bugging you then sesmscriptf i just we just have different ideas of what this night is suppose to look like sesmscriptm its not that complicated we come down here the grunions arrive they do their little fish thing we say ooh awe look at the little fish and then they go home and we go home sesmscriptf for gods sake augie its grow up were not going to see the grunion sesmscriptm why not sesmscriptf we we dont ever have we ever sesmscriptm weve missed them twice thats hardly ever sesmscriptf twice is every time weve tried thats ever sesmscriptm well well see them this year sesmscriptf no we wont its like waiting up for santa clause or something i feel like as though my whole life is going to be standing on the beach waiting with my eyes opened expectantly my hands clasped neatly in front of me waiting for fish to show up and the fish will not show up sesmscriptm okey theyre just fish its nothing to get traumatized over sesmscriptf you dont understand anything i am saying sesmscriptm no of course not sesmscriptf i did want to see it i always want to see it i just i keep thinking this will be the time and it never is sesmscriptm im trying to work this backwards but i cant seem to pinpoint the time where everything went wrong here okay so sesmscriptm you were fine on the phone call with marge eating dinner was finetalking uh washing the dishes no problem all right so im taking a shower youre watching tv the news and you say the grunions are running tonight and i say great lets go im feeling lucky and so all right and im putting on my coat im putting out the animals im pulling the car out of the garage sesmscriptf do you remember the first time that we came to see the grunion it was about four years ago right after we got married we thought i was pregnant we had a bottle of champagne and no glasses you asked me to dance we took off our shoes and while we were dancing you said the most intimate things to me right in my ear so i could feel them as much as hear them sesmscriptf and i remember thinking to myself finally i am as happy as i am supposed to be sesmscriptm wait a minute ive got it sesmscriptf dancing barefoot in the sand drinking champagne out of the bottle sesmscriptm it was in the car right when we were passing knickerbocker liquor locker you said lets stop and get champagne and i said that times a wasting or something like that right you wanted it to be like it was before right sesmscriptf i would rather not remember some things id rather not hope for something sesmscriptm okay all right no problem i totally understand okey um listen do you want to dance sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm do you want me to go get some champagne sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm take off our shoes sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm what you want me to blow in your ear sesmscriptf laughter no sesmscriptm do you want to get married again what what do you want a divorce sesmscriptfxx no sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm a vacation sesmscriptf no sesmscriptm a poodle a backrub a spa a suicide pack what carla what the hell do you want sesmscriptf i just want i just want things to turn out the way they are supposed to sesmscriptm well welcome to the human race do you think this is what i had planned do you think that when i proposed that i had this great fantasy going that four years down the road we would end up arguing on the beach over some fish sesmscriptm do you think that i thought there would be times when you would look at me like i was used kleenex or i would look at you and think good god whens the next flight to alaska no no im just like you i thought it would all be like peaches and roses and sand in our toes and wind in our hair and the fish would always come and the bills would magically pay themselves and wed have three fat rosy kids but ha ha baby the jokes on us sesmscriptm because you know what you get carla you know what you get this sesmscriptf this what is this this isnt even anything sesmscriptm yes it is sesmscriptf sure this is standing on the beach this is waiting this is fighting sesmscriptm right sesmscriptf but this isnt at all what i wanted it to be sesmscriptm now i know me either sesmscriptf this is just this i mean its a lot and everything but its not you know something else am i making any sense sesmscriptm im trying the best i can sesmscriptf i know that augie i do i know that and and i know that this meant a lot to you and and its special you know with the sand and the moon but sesmscriptf but i just couldnt help thinking about being somewhere else sesmscriptm maybe if youre with somebody else too sesmscriptf i didnt say that sesmscriptm no i know but i know i dont make you happy sesmscriptf for heavens sake augie whatever i am doing id rather it be with you
